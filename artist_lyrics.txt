2 ContributorsAfter The Storm Lyrics
And after the storm
I run and run as the rains come
But I look up, I look up
On my knees and out of luck, I look up
Night has always pushed up day
You must know life to see decay
But I won't rot, I won't rot
Not this mind and not this heart
I won't rot

And I took you

7 ContributorsAfter The Titanic LyricsIn your eyes
I can see a storm coming
And in your eyes
I can see myself
But oh, don't fail me now
This love I've found
Don't fall away, yeah
Cuttin' in-

In your eyes
And in your eyes
I can see a storm coming
In your eyes
I can see myself
But oh, don't fail me now
This love I've found
Don't fall away

In your eyes

7 ContributorsAgain Lyrics
Does it feel good, that I'm gone again?
Is it enough, that I'm wrong again?
And you, won't know
And you, don't know
That you, took it all and it falls again but I don't care anymore

And all we got is slowly falling, ooh
I'd just do it all again and ooh
I can feel the future calling and life won't get the best of me again
All we got is slowly falling and life won't get the best of me again
