I can't find you
But can't fault you, 'cause I
Can get so caught up in my own head
You just float through, I can't catch you
And I can understand but can't face the feeling
That I'm just another end
So when you coming home?
I could be what you need, girl
If you want me to
You know what they say, bruh
That love gon' come back to you
But I can float too, and I don't ask for much from you
And maybe that's too much, too soon
So I, keep rolling through the blackout
No fires without some fallout
Made peace out of the pieces
Now I can't take it back now, no
But I keep on track now up
And yeah, that's all of it
I gave up my youth for this 'cause I wanted it, and
If you think that I need you then you're out of your head
But I want you
So bring me down and drown me out
I'll be waiting here when you're ready
And I'll lay me down, unfinished now
It hurts
So when you coming home?
I could be what you need, girl
If you want me to
You know what they say, bruh
That love gon' come back to you
Come back to you, come back to you
Oh, it's always you, gon' come back to you
Come back to you, gon' come back to you, yeah
Come back to you
So bring me down and drown me out
I'll be waiting here when you're ready
And I'll lay me down, unfinished
Yeah, yeah, oh
When you coming home?
I could be what you need, girl
If you want me to, if you let me
You know what they say, bruh
That love gon' come back to you
"There you go Jonathon that's another problem solved"

Feel for me
Feel for me
Feel for me
(Follow me and you will see)
(Follow me and you will see)
(Follow me and you will see)
Feel for me
Feel for me
Feel for me
Feel for me
Feel for me
Feel for me
(Follow me and you will see)
Do you feel for me?(Follow me and you will see)
Do you feel for me?(Follow me and you will see)
Feel for me (Follow me and you will see)
Do you feel for me?
(Follow me and you will see)
(Follow me and you will see)

And you keep fucking with my mood swings
Just want the things, I don't want you
Now I'm so bored of this and
There's some things I don't ever get to feel
Roof down, Testarossa, arms swaying in the breeze
There's some things I won't get to relive
Rooftop, arms 'round each other, momentarily we were alright
What in the world could've changed your mind?
What kind of world do you dream about?
I dreamt of death and it eased my mind
Baby, don't stress, happens all the time
We misconnect, I don't pay no mind
What kind of love could leave me behind?
I think of the end just to ease my mind
I know it's dark but it helps
You're mad 'cause she loves you
Wish you could see the other side sometimes
And stop asking, if you don't wanna know
Sometimes I don't wanna know
But there's some dreams I won't ever get to fill
Roof down, Testarossa, arms swaying in the breeze
There's some things I won't get to relive
Rooftop, arms 'round each other, momentarily we were alright
What in the world could've changed your mind?
What kind of world can you dream about?
I dreamt of death and I eased my mind
Baby, don't stress, happens all the time
We misconnect, I don't pay no mind
What kind of love could you leave behind?
I think of the end just to ease my mind
I know it's dark but it helps
I know it's dark but it helps
I know it's dark but it's hell
I know it's dark but it's hell
I know it's dark but it helps

Cold out
Raining with chords now
You're crying your heart out
Trying to make less calls now
Lately I've come through
Telling you to slow down
I want a
I gotta head out
Bet you think I'm overplaying my trust issues
Bet you think I'm lying so I can fuck with you
I ain't got a reason to be home with you
Home with you (Home with you)
I ain't coming home with you (Home with you)
Baby, slow down
Raining at four in the morn'
Can't speak my language
Everything seems fine right now
If I'm down I'm all in
Show you out if I show up
I can't go all in
But you think I'm overplaying my trust issues
Think I'm lying so I can fuck with you
I ain't even  baby I need you
Every time I can't be here I just want
You need friends like us
It’s not trust
It’s locked up
Been waiting for you, oh you
It's not love
Don’t feel the trust
Been waiting on you, yeah
Yeah yeah
Life with no limits
No, I can't gauge the distance
No
Don't keep tabs 'round and manage it
Anxiety and the internet
Can't speak because I'm indifferent
Built time of our friendship
Will type 'til it finishes, you know
Oh down, baby slow it down
Give that showdown, baby slow it down
Can't control it now, baby throw it down
You remind me of my shows when you sold out
Spend my money and it go down
She need me when I need her and I can't go now
You need friends like us
It’s locked up
It’s not trust
Been waiting on you, oh you
It's not love
Don’t feel the trust
Been waiting on you, yeah
Yeah yeah

I didn't really know what to say, um, so I thought I'd build a road, um
When I was like 12, I started making beats on my family computer
Um, by the time I was 15 I'd stolen it to my attic bedroom and I was, I was hooked
Um, I started putting the things I made online, that's The Eden Project, and just didn't stop
I never sent them anywhere, or even told my friends, but I just put them out there
Um, like, endless music for like three years and it just grew and grew
Um, I think I was luckily just in a cusp of a wave, really
Suddenly music could be produced by anyone with a computer and I just happened to be early
But suddenly, something crystallized, in winter of like 2014, and I knew I had something to say, and I knew what shape it was, finally
Um, so when End Credits was released in 2015 for free, a couple of interesting things started to happen
It was downloaded from my site about 15,000 times in a couple days
And I knew I had a fanbase, um, but, I'd never seen it in like a central number like that
It was spread across whatever uploads or songs, and, my first monthly payment, um, from having music on Spotify early that year was like 42 dollars and 62 cent
Which quickly grew into enough to support me, and a career of music, or at least an attempt of one
Um, and then suddenly after End Credits there's just more emails than I could handle, I had multiple meetings with various record labels, publishers, managers, lawyers, um, daily for about six weeks
Um, I was definitely in over my head but at least secure because I had money coming in, you know?
I could, I could say no
So I told everyone no, um, aside from my current manager and eventually the Astralwerks team, later, about a year later in 2016
I started, I started touring and everything just got bigger and bigger, I played to like 200 people for free in London, and then 450 paid tickets the same year
And I think, next time I played in London it was for 2,400 people
All three shows sold out really quickly, it was, I couldn't keep up with myself at all, basically
Um, I don't think I allowed myself to stop and enjoy anything, I was just hyper focused on going, you know, just forward
Going on tour, whatever, I was just moving, um
And in a weird way it was for the best and uhh, and for the worst, because, because of the work I put in I have a career, you know, doing what I love, which is one of the greatest things I could ever ask for
But, um, I definitely lost myself to it all, and I lost, I lost an  that I saw when I was 17
So, fast forward to 2019, I just, I spent as much time at home as I possibly could, um, I flew as little as I could, um
And it's still an ongoing process, I kinda just stripped all the things I built up away from underneath me to, to find the road, um, or at least try to
Um, I had some of the best times of my life this year, and some of the worst
Um, I said goodbye to a friend too soon
Um, I made some really difficult choices and, I, well I let myself cry about it which is, important, you know?
Um, now at the end of it all, um, I feel like I'm starting to see myself again, um
The present is a platform, build as you see fit, um
No plans, only godspeed
No future, only ideas
And we've made it this far
Ten tonne, ballast on my chest
As I woke up, a heavy inhale
For the nights-

You know, our progress is just really slow
Because we're trying to just find ways through
And we're just veering
Backwards at times just to get through some of this stuff
And it's just crazy, all the things that we have to do

Last night was a car crash
Highlights meet a quick end
Live the high life 'fore the weekends
Coming down hard to the sunset sinking in
Didn't try hard for a diehard
Nothing I can say that you won't get wrong
And everybody asks where you're gone now
Can you only really want what you don't have enough?
Everything you ever wanted adding up
To be the reason you can't stand it now
You talk a lot, well act like it
Finally found a way to get myself untangled
And undone, but it's alright
This ain't been the dream in a long time
Make sure you play the music when my time's up
Oh, just say it, I'm done
So if you loved me, how was I supposed to know?
'Cause now we're fading and losing what we wanted most
But in spite of how you feel, it's not the end of the world
Some say these things are for the best
How are you so sure?
And you can find me where the sea pours into the stars
I'll get there someday
I hope you find everything you think that you want
Bruises will fade
Time on our side, we can wait for it
I'll be doing fine, if you are
'Cause life is but a dream
Only as real as you let it be
So if you loved me, how was I supposed to know?
'Cause now we're fading and losing what we wanted most
But in spite of how you feel, it's not the end of the world
Some say these things are for the best
For better or worse

(Ooh, ooh)
I was thinking
The cordons drawn
The eyes are wrung
The song is sung, mm-mm
The bloody morning
A face of god
It's all it was (Ooh, ooh), ah
And I loved him (I loved, loved)
And I killed him (Killed, ooh)
I loved him, I killed him (Killed, woah, yeah)
A night at court
Hollywood
That's all it was (Woah, woah)
A violent mess (Ooh)
It's to the right over there
Sing down the lens
That's all you get
Aw, I can't believe you've done this
And I loved it (I loved, loved)
And I killed it (Killed, ooh)
I loved it (I loved), I killed it (Killed)
(It)
I could use a call and some old friеnds (Yeah)
The sky was on the floor, can't see no еnd (So far, yeah, yeah)
(I tried, can't)
And they said, "Where you been?" I said, "Nowhere"
Been trying to figure out where the hope went
I'm a glimmer in the night
You can pin your hopes to
I'm a refraction of the sky
You can pin your hopes to

hello
I always wonder why birds choose to stay in
the same place when they could fly
anywhere on earth
- I then ask myself the same.
i think it doesnt matter if youre aware of it
or not
how tidal everything seems
that one day you might stand on paradise
not move and soon be drowning
or how some things you left behind
wait for you in your hotel room, some place
for latent change
to be reclimbed, reassembled
and unknotted
for me to say anything i must first have
listened
for you to find anything you have to look
even in some small way
As above so below
the blue, the blue, and blue
Running, tripping, falling
it was kind of like waking up from a dream
those lifelike episodes
you second guess yourself wondering
if any of it actually happened
The last forever in third person
A chase cam rolling with the current
Pushed, moved,
and pulled out of view
and ive been thinking about a change of
pace
or the pace of change
or how the last few years were a singularity
you were the universe folding in on itself
information bleeds
no name
no location
no frame of reference
Running, tripping, falling
Just echos and a sense that something had
happened here
unsure of what it was i turned around and
carried on

My babe told them that the worst thing for me was myself, yeah
Cold days, the winter had his grip tight around my chest, yeah
Always coming down the thought I won't stop loving you
And I learned to, but I'm never letting go
And now I'm so sick of picking up the pieces
I love it when I waste your time, yeah
The same shit, you'll be over on the weekend
Wonder how we got so
So tangled up, up
I wanted you to know I can't stay, no
I gotta let you go
In my head, lost
I'm falling for your love
Burn my head, with your arms 'round my neck
Know I'm best on my
Revolver around your waist
I chasе you step-by-step, yeah
Thеy're just fucking with your head
Can't keep on track
'Cause I been waiting for you
Only to be out here by myself
And the way you have me holding on
Got so bad for my health
And she said I'm so sick of picking up the pieces
I love it when you waste my time, yeah
The same shit, you'll be over on the weekend
Wonder how we got so
So tangled up, oh
I wanted you to know I can't stay, no
I gotta let you go
In my head, lost
I'm falling for your love
Burn my head, with your arms 'round my neck
Know I'm best on my, my
Said it one time
Before the line died
I wanted more life
I got a whole night
And I got no ties
I got one second
Well baby, go take it
I got enough problems
I've had enough playing already
Don't say it if you're never going far, I bet it
Oh, baby, I'm bored, do not say it
You want me, but you won't say it
You want me, but you won't say it
So tangled up, up
I wanted you to know I can't stay, no
I gotta let you go
In my head, lost
I'm falling for your love
Burn my head, with your arms 'round my neck
Know I'm best on my, my

Kabhi ek baat acchi lagti hai, kabhi dusri
A pause in timing, caught capsizing
Run it backward, one hand through the other
You wouldn't pull me out, how can I come down?
Carried by the wind, so far from hope now
Is the past always before?
Woah
I'm, I'm not- I'm not quite-
I'm- Not sure w- Wh-

Another night chasing, this feels like home
Since I've been miles away from change
Outside or inside looking dazed
Just wash the glitter off your face and go home
And this enthralling shadow's gone, ghost town
It's strange to think that we were strangers once
It's square one
I guess it's something where I want more than I've got
But I can't ask you for the things you don't feel
Don't
Cause I don't want no fake love, fake love, fake love
Don't wanna know no fake friends, forced smiles to save us
I don't wanna know no fake love, fake love, fake love
Just say what you wanna say
And I'll still be here
It's easy when you've nothing to lose
And I'll still be there
Cause I've got no hope
Yeah
She told me love me fast or take it slow
I said I'm going nowhere fast as hell
And keeping with the times we gotta keep it on the low
Midnight habits burning through the summer since the snow and
I finally feel myself again
It's been so long, I thought I'd see the end
I guess you need ends to begin again
Again, again
Cause this is nothing we ain't seen before
Lived through it I ain't overdosed
The sky is falling like it always does
Can't you see a storm's watching over us
Let it rain
The clouds look heavy, but they bare no weight
Scars can't hurt you, bruises will fade
Don't
Cause I don't want no fake love, fake love, fake love
Don't wanna know no fake friends, forced smiles to save us
I don't wanna know no fake love, fake love, fake love
Just say what you wanna say
And I'll still be here
It's easy when you've nothing to lose
And I'll still be there
Cause I've got no hope
Don't
Cause I don't want no fake love, fake love, fake love
Don't wanna know no fake friends, forced smiles to save us
I don't wanna know no fake love, fake love, fake love
Just say what you wanna say

Time may heal me
break the sounds

It's only been my whole life

That's better
Heart beat, blunt feel, can't sleep
Cold, but it's still burning
Your precious time wasting, on me
So why you gotta drag me?
I've been in a hole since like last week
And I'm holding on, I've held on, I'm holed up
'Cause you love in, and you love in, streams
Seasonal life bringer
'Cause you love in, yeah, you love in, streams
But I can't keep swimming uphill, woah
Wonder how we'll call it in the light
Saharan heat had me driving in the sky
Throwing stones 'cause you're getting bored
Kids in glass houses don't wear a lot of clothes
Okay, so why you gotta drag me?
I've been in a hole since like last week
And I'm holding up, I've held on, I'm holding on
'Cause you love in, and you love in, streams, streams
'Cause you love in, you love in, streams
But I can't keep swimming uphill
'Cause you love in, you love in, streams
Oh, the only way is up from here
Heartbeats drowned out
Let me go now (To the haters?)
Blunt feel trauma (To the youth)
Sleepless cycle (To the youth!)
Precess further
Do something, anything, do whatever, you know?
Start a milk factory, go make uh, magazine
Uh, get a job, draw a painting
Do anything, you know?
Have fun, stay safe, safe sex, safe drugs
And, uh, have fun, that's it

The sky was on the floor
Couldn't see no end (end)
You said "where you been?"
I said "nowhere."
Wish I could disappear like the ocean
Now I hate you were out
Answered no texts
But when I close my eyes you move closer
I'm tryna figure out where the hope went
Don't wanna talk about it in the past tense

And just one moment
Is all I ask for
Just one talk between us
And just one second now
Some perfect clarity
And eighty hours alone
And I swore to god that I wouldn't cry
And I swore to you I can't see
How it's anything more than a lie
And all these years
I won't ever let them go
All my fears
They'll bring me down, down so low
And I'll be missing you
For a lifetime
But eighteen years are better than none
Until the time comes for me
To turn to dust
So I'll get on fine
My mind turned inside out
I've always found it easy
To hide these thoughts of mine
A collapsing state of mind
I'll sink to where thoughts can't find me
And I swore to god that I wouldn't cry
And I swore to you I can't see
How it's anything more than a lie
And all these years
I won't ever let them go
All my fears
They'll bring me down, down so low
And I'll be missing you
For a lifetime
But eighteen years are better than none
Until the time comes for me
To turn, to turn
And we all hurt
And time heals nothing at all
Decisions made and they cut me off
From all I've ever known
And I can't think
No, I can't breathe
I can't be what I want to with this weight on me
I wish I had
Selective amnesia
To keep you away from me
But I'll be missing you
For a lifetime
But eighteen years are better than none
Until the time comes for me
To turn to dust

Cold out, raining on the calls now
Crying your heart out, crime and fast cars now
Lately when I come through, tell you to slow down
I wanna ghost out, I gotta throw down here
You think I'm down-playing my trust issues
You think l'm lyin' so I can fuck on you
I ain't got a reason to be home with you (home with you, yeah)
Home with you (home with you)
I ain't coming home with you (home with you, yeah)
Baby, slow down, raining, it's pouring out
Can't speak my language, everything seems foreign now
If l'm down, l'm all in, show you off and show out
I can't go all in
But you think I'm over playing my trust issues (trust, yeah)
Think I'm lying just so I can fuck with you (Ooh)
They leave, and then can't do it, baby I give you
I ain't got a reason to be home with you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
You've been cursed like us
It's all it doеs, it's what it does
Now I'm falling for you, fuck you
It's how it goes, don't feel trust
And I'm waitin' on you, hey
Oh, oh
Livе a life with no limits
Now I can't gauge the distance
From a space which then vanished
Thirty tabs trying to manage it
Anxiety on the internet
Can't sleep cause I'm indifferent
Kill time, I revenge it
Hold tight till it ventures
You know
Go down, baby, slow it down
It's a showdown (slowdown)
And throw it down, can't control it down
Baby, throw it down, uh (throw it down, I can't help)
You remind me of my shows when you sold out (l'm sold out bitch, yeah)
Getting my money up, it's the G.O.A.T. now (go, go, go, go, go)
Only see you put me on since I'm up now (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Getting my money up, it's the G.O.A.T. now
But she make me wanna leave, but I can't go now (trust)
You've been cursed like us
It's all it does, it's what it does
Now I'm falling for you, fuck you
It's how it goes, don't feel trust
And I'm waitin' on you, hey
Oh, oh

And we're just veering, backwards at times
Just to get through some of the stuff
And it's just crazy, all the things that we have to do
Uh, it's just crazy, we're gonna keep going
And, see what happens, thanks for following along
We still remain optimistic
And are, persevering towards our—

Don't know how well this is gonna be
But, the basic idea is—
Free fall for now
Desert air won't drown you out
And for a second I thought the world was ending
And I couldn't breathe in
Yeah, and so this isn't your time
Yeah, been chasing kairos with those scapegoat eyes
Can't you realize?
Fuck the summertime, it's you
So scared of overgrowing youth
When it's not done with you
And everybody gon' run, run
Everybody gon' run, run
And you can call it what you want
But I call it moving on
And I'm so done with singing words I don't believe in no more
So what you rushing for?
Who said it's now or never?
I think you're taking on the wrong advice
But it's alright if these are your worst times
You know you're good
You're good
And if you want you can breathe on your own
This isn't what I thought but it's beautiful
Make peace with your mistakes and they'll turn to gold
Weightless, I let  go
And everybody gon' run, run
Everybody gon' run, run
And you can call it what you want
But I call it moving on
And I'm so done with singing words I don't believe in no more
No more, call it what you want
Call it what you want but I call it growing up and I'm done

And I can't see a way through
And I can't be myself around you
If I'm honest, I can't stop myself
From thinkin' it's all over (Yeah)
You're gonna stop crying
And after the end comes whatever
(Forever I still think of you)
And ever you need me
(And ever you've lost touch of you)
These songs all loop
Touchdown, giant leap
Heartbreak, Godspeed
Highlight, headland
Edge of the world, fading out
And I loved how the sky burned
Soaking now, we slip apart
(Soaking now, I'm fallin' apart)
Older now, I can't tell you and me apart (Apart)
I just wanted to let you know (You)
That I burnt when the sky heard
(Sky heard how you stopped)
Disintegrate and fall apart (Plain sight)
Running out of time (Unfolding inside)
Can never beat the lesser (The courage drought)
Of idle stress, and all the rest of it
Enough to move you
I'm just scared that you'll cu—
Still, I loved every second of it!
And I can't have the past and where I'm going
Said just take the best of all the pieces
(How one loose end, and one step)
And the reasons you're gone
(Look inside, and you left)
Still, I see myself in all the people I let go!
(Déjà vu, pass through)
I'm just scared that you'll le—
Yeah, older now
I keep pouring over those lives white lies
Holding out, how many seconds 'til the roof falls in?
So ice the hurt (Soaking now, I'm fallin' apart)
Last time enough, forever breaks us up
And connotations burnt into my lexicon (Yeah)
Foreign feelings riot until the past is won
All my friends forgot but I'm still holding on
I keep fucking up my lines get crossed
And you wanna die often
How you gonna hide all those tears from me?
All you wanted just slipped through changing times
It's not the same
Oh, I'm just scared that you'll cu—
Still, I loved every second of it!
And I can't have the past and where I'm going
Said just take the best of all the pieces
(How one loose end, and one step)
And the reasons you're gone
(Look inside, and you left)
Still, I see myself in all the people I let go!
(Déjà vu, pass through)
I'm just scared that you'll le—

But really there was so much more to it than that.
I know you've probably read this in some fucking interview or something I've done or live streamed before, but like, I feel... for a long time I felt in the same place as End Credits, you know?
And so... I think you think too much of me is one way to get around that, but I really... You know, I just want to regress, I don't feel like I have - I'm halfway there but it's like 'shit I haven't really been doing anything for the last year.' And I've been saying I've been doing a shit ton but like, in terms of... I don't know.
The fall of last year I've been living in my fucking head 1000 miles in the sky not really 'in it' I guess. It's good to just get back down to earth. Wow that's really fucking... hipster or whatever, you know what I mean.
In terms of music though honestly it's been kind of hit and miss. I feel like I got a lot of cool shit I want to make and say, but it's - I don't think I'm in the right place right now.
Like I'm having cool ideas that I know and like a lot of shit that I want to achieve, and I mean like things I want to say but I don't think I'm in the right place right now. So I'm cool with just kicking it back and laying it easy. I just don't feel like it's connecting fully right now. I'm not even back for like 2 weeks and I was gone all in the last week and I'd be gone in London again in the next week, so I'm not really in the zone. Just gonna grow up a bit in the next month or two or four or five or whatever and it'll happen eventually. I don't know. Buuuuuuut I forget what else I was gonna say.

Of course I'm scared
Would I be thinking straight if I wasn't?
Of course I'm scared sometimes
Even if I say it don't faze me
Or if I say I'm not hazy
But drowning ain't so bad
'Cause at least you know where you're going
And we're all future bound
So I guess that's really the same thing
But I always liked the thought of maybe being a runaway
I could be your lover and you could be my heartache
I could sing the songs that we used to sing when we were kids
Maybe that could bring us back to before we got stuck in that
I want to be like John Dillinger
Just try and catch me if you can
And we could drive off in the sunset
Even if it's not the plan
'Cause plans are overrated
'Cause you never really know where you're going
And the past is always changing
Ain't been gold since I remembered it that way
But I always liked the thought of maybe being a runaway
I could be your lover and you could be my heartache
And I could sing the songs that we used to sing way back when

EDEN feels like his relationship with his girlfriend is breaking down, and there is no way to save it anymore.
I'll say it once for the Bayside
I come alive when the light dies
Overcast but we're inside
Eyes wide, lied twice
My advice don't mean shit tonight
'Cause I've been driving though I can't see shit and I've
Been lying through my teeth just to get the feeling right
And feel alright
So girl just turn the lights down
Yeah
And too many times I've been caught up when I know better
So I push it back down 'cause I never want to let it out
But I've been dying since I saw you were gone
Forget me 'cause I ain't waiting for no-one
'Cause I ain't waiting for no-one
And I've been trying to dig my way out of the ocean
And punch a hole in the sky
And flood the light through to midnight
And I don't know where you're going
You can't expect the past to repeat with the ending changed
So don't forget where you came from
And we are never alone
Drops making waves in the ocean
(Phone rings...)
Hello?
Hello?
Can you hear me?
Ok...

Music softly playing in an Uber through the park
Thought you said you'd hate someone kiss you in the dark
I’ll go by myself when I'm feeling it
Put you on a plane and it's breaking my heart
Talkin’ of another time, this one's getting old
But looking out, out forever
Watch the sun come up
From the starboard side
You been M.I.A since 2015
Oh yeah
'Cause I could, I move on my feet
Called you when I was in need
No reply, that's just something that I'm used to
Moonwalking's something that you used to do
Bathing in the day, woah
While it pools to the surface
Can you catch me now?
Can you talk me down?
I don't feel alive when I see you no more
Caught me by surprise one time, now I know
That's on you now, you owe me that
You were all I had one time
Now I’ve come so far
You been M.I.A since 2015
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Don’t come back for me
Don't confuse happiness with feeling loved
Won’t keep waiting on it if it's killing me
Been tryna disappear and it kept breaking my heart
Love is always free
Even just an inch away from blowing up
And if you say it, one stop
And you're apart, but you want it
Can you catch me now?
Can you talk me down?
I don't feel alive when I see you no more
Caught me by surprise couple times, now I’m sure
That's on you now, you owe me that
You were all I had one time
Now I've come so far
You been M.I.A since 2015
Oh yeah
'Cause I could, I move on my feet
Called you when I was in need
But silence is something I got used to
Moonwalking's something that I used to do
I miss you, I miss you, I missed you, yeah

It adds a third verse that ends the song in a slower pace.
Yeah, she’s in love with the concept
As if we’re all just how she imagined
'Cause we’re in love but just don’t know it yet, huh
Well, tell me how am I supposed to see the magic?
'Cause I don’t believe in it no more
But I won’t tell her
'Cause I always imagined
It’s easier if she thinks she won
So I'ma let her, and she said
"I don’t think I love you no more
You never seem to call me lately"
Girl I don’t think you know me at all
'Cause I never thought I'd have to say this
No I don’t love you, and I never did
Look at us burning down in flames for kicks
But just know
I’m not singing for your XO
I’m just singing 'cause it's over
Came and went like the summertime
Was that a sunset or a sunrise?
Looking back like where’d the time go?
So much for trying to keep this moving slow
'Cause I don’t believe in her no more
But I remember
How we talked shit like we knew what we wanted
And I still remember what she said
"I don’t think I love you no more
You never seem to call me lately"
But I don’t think she knew me at all
'Cause I never thought I'd have to say this
But I’m no liar, and I never hid
Anything, you should have seen it coming to this
Just know
I’m not singing for an ex though
I’m just singing 'cause it's over
Girl I’m just singing
Just singing yeah
I’m just singing 'cause it's over
'Cause I've been trying to find another way
And I've been trying to get my story straight
Oh I've been saying if I ever change
Then it's going slow cause I've got me and all these ghosts I won't let go of
Oh yeah, you got way too many questions
'Bout the way of my decision
Got us stuck in this position
'Bout to break me down
And she can't hate me like I hate myself
And my skills
I’m lying for the thrill
I might just be destined, can’t love
But that's just how I feel
I need to see your world to know it’s real
Yeah
Oh and that's just how I feel
I feel
That's just how I feel
Oh yeah
And she said no I don't think I love you no more
That's just how I feel

I forget what I'm doing here
I can't focus on anything
Sunset blinding me and my friends
Turning minds into Stonehenge
Newgrange, little star gone
UK single-spin experiment
Want to be a person
Reroute to be back to Bethlehem
Genesis, a lost time
Didn't wake up, but it's morning now
Peer pressure, I'ma cannonball
Sky-dive through the swimming pool
Splashing on an impulse
Radiating with some edibles
Call me if you're sinking
Crushing on you with my atom bomb
I don't have to wake up
I don't have to bе here
You don't have to lovе me
I don't need a godsend
Just love it when it's bright out
Sunrise is calling
Just feel it when it's loudest
I can believe it, yeah
Love what's left, of what's left, of what's left
Turn your best, turn your-
Take a breath, in my breath, in my-
I'll get it right in the next life
I'll get it, I'll get it, yeah
Seeing the stars
It hit me like a freight line
Though, it's all coming my whole life
Chasing, my county prestige now
Arching over immigrants and meltdowns
Flaming up my calls from your mansions
I don't give a fuck about your bag now
Did this really happen, how am I here?
Prediction, now predicated to my fears
How do I explain that I'm really fucking sad
When it's not your fault, I have everything
Love what's left, of what's left, of what's left
Turn your best, turn your best, turn your-
Is this working out?
Take a breath, in my breath, in my-
Working out
I'll get it right in the next life
I'll get it, I'll get it, yeah
Heal me now time, time may heal me
Heartbreaks outside, it's a long ride down after the peak
I don't have to wake up
I don't have to be here
You don't have to love me
I don't need a godsend
Just love it when it's bright out
The sunrise is calling
I feel at peace
I could believe

Cold out
Rainin' with chords now
Cryin' your heart out
Crimin', fast cars now
Lately, I'll come through
Tell you to slow down
I wanna go now
I gotta ghost out of here
Bet you think I'm overplayin' my trust issues
Bet you think I'm lyin' so I can fuck with you
I ain't got a reason to be home with you (home with you)
Home with you (home with you)
I ain't coming home with you (come with you)
, slow down
Rainin', it's pourin' now
Can't speak my language
Everything seems fucked now
If I'm down, I'm all in
Show you up if I show out
I can't go all in
But you think I'm overplayin my trust issues
Think I'm lyin just so I can fuck with you
baby I need you
Anytime I can't be there, I just
You need friends like us
It's not trust
It's locked up
Been waiting on you
It's not love
Don't feel trust
Been waiting on you, yeah
Life with no limits
Now can't gauge the distance
No
manage it
Anxiety on the internet
Can't spеak cos I'm indifferent
Built time ovеr friendship
you know
Go down, baby slow it down
Baby throw it down, can't control it now, baby throw it down
You remind me of my shows when you sold out
Gimme my money  ()
Gimme my money
I can't go now
You need friends like us
It's locked up
It's not trust
Been waiting on you
It's not love
Don't feel trust
Been waiting on you, yeah

Tu sais que la vie, elle est belle
Mais si on, si on n'voit plus la vie comme...
Du coup c'est un peu triste
Il faut en profiter de la vie
La vie, c'est joli, c'est beau
On peut voyager, chanter, rigoler
Sur la terre, tout est joli, tout est jolie
Y'a plein de choses que j'ai vues qui sont jolies
Les chansons douces, les bébés
Tout ça, c'est chouette
Du coup, faut en profitеr que s'ils seront grands
Mais c'est chouеtte d'avoir des copains sur la terre
Après quand on meurt, on ne les voit plus
C'est triste
Mais y'a les méchants papa
Oui, mais il y a des méchants partout
Il y a des méchants partout
Ils ont des pistolets
Ils peuvent nous tirer dessus parce qu'ils sont très sont très méchants, papa
Eux, ils ont des pistolets
Nous, on a des fleurs
Bah les fleurs ça fait rien
C'est pour, c'est pour, c'est pour
Bah si, regarde
Tu vois, tout le monde pose des fleurs
Oui?
C'est pour combattre les pistolets
C'est pour protéger?
Voilà
Et les bougies aussi?
C'est pour ne pas oublier les gens qui sont partis hier
C'est pour nous protéger les fleurs et les bougies
Oui
Vous sentez-vous mieux?
Oui, ça va mieux

The water was cool, and you're shining
The windows were burning patterns in my mind
Running away was so tiring
Holding your stare, I felt miles behind
And how do you love when you're frightened?
The thought of me fucking up all these threads
Situations I know are just passing
I'm holding on for you, and static feel
The light ran down the wall, holding back the stars
Dividing us in new ways away from sleep
Confusion has its cost, wave pools in the dark
Crashing 'round my head
The water was cool, and you're shining
The windows were burning patterns in my mind
Running away was so tiring
Holding your stare, I slip miles behind
And how do you love when you're frightеned?
The thought of me fucking up all thеse threads
Situations I know are just passing
I'm holding on for you, and how to sleep
The light ran down the wall, holding back the stars
Dividing us in new ways away from sleep
Confusion has its cost, wave pools in the dark
Crashing 'round my head (Ah, ah, ah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

And if these days were living encores, encore
Then and tell me, do you scream?
Even when every thing's a nightmare
It's something we've all seen
'Cause we let everyone we love fall down
Like a lead sky brings the night
And that's all we are
'Cause we get off on hiding everything we are
So tell me you love me
I will too
So tell me you loath me
I do too
And I been thinking that
The more I grow
The more that I'll lose touch with what I love, and time it flows
So much faster than anything I've ever known
I've always been a dreamer
So what happens when I wake up?
I'm not afraid of growing older
I'm just afraid of letting go
Um, I usually write a poem for each body of work I do
Or just randomly too, I guess
But yeah, here it is:
Stop
You are not broken
There is no fix
There is a change
You are not your job, your significant other, the numbers in your bank account, the thoughts or the memories in your head
What ever anyone says: whatever
You are the words you speak, the way you move
This can change at any time as you decide
Choose wisely
Does your love mean anything if I can't feel it?
If I threw myself off a building am I a martyr or a tragedy?
However you may feel momentarily, only two factors persevere:
Your relationship to the people around you, and your view of yourself
You could buy that x if you wanted to
But think about it, if you came home like you did would it change a thing?
You are inconstant, dynamic
You're a star darling, act like one
Take care of the ones that you love
Stop being so serious
Now is not forever
But you knew all this, deep down
Maybe we are forever ending where we started
But it is only the end if you want it to be
Everything is only ever what you would like it to be;
Never as great or as grave as it seems
No matter how close or how impossibly far you think you got to that greener grass
We just have to try again
We just have to try again

Yeah
It's funny how the seasons change
Remember it's so different
But the days all feel the same
And I ain't seen sunlight in so long
But now all the leaves are back
Wonder why they left it all
And I see the times before, yeah
But now I know it's not just leaves
Who leave you and it's colder
The days get shorter
My skin gets thicker
My crew gets thinner
Regardless of grinding like Tony H or Jon Bellion
And he said it takеs a while to see the brilliance
But oncе the confidence shit's intimidating, isn't it?
And I can scream and shout
About how I feel like I ain't giving shit
But I don't give a shit cause' I only do this for love
And now you want a piece of me?
Yeah, I'll give you time
But I'll never let you get the best of me
And I'll say it - I ain't been on since never
But I'm all right now
And I'm kind and I will make this last forever
And you said, I'm done, I can't
I'll just say it, I got it
Cause' everything just right, right now
Yeah, everything is right, right now
This is my time, now
The future is screaming out so bright, right now
Taking fly, right now
But the end of the night goes
Everything is..
Everything is right, yeah
Everything is right, yeah
Everything is all right (hah, so)
It's your boy (Jay)
Hi guys! (hah, fuck that)

Is all I want
Something more than superficial
Is all I want
The sound of the words you know
Is all I want
Sex, drugs, and rock & roll
Is all I want
Whoa-oa

Oh, oh, oh
Does it feel?
I'm where you want me
Conversation fragmenting
You give advice like a magic 8-ball (dream)
Still feel like the secret's at the back of my mouth
Some would say let go or be dragged
If you could fly, I'm sure you would
Oh, 'cause, oh
Baby, you're so green
You'd think you was made for me
It's kind of dark
But what's a dream if not made of memory?
And if you could see the future
Would you want to travel forward at all? (again)
It's cause opposites attract
And recreate your habits again
Deep down, you really want to go
You don't really care if I know
Calling all your friends just so
You can never tell what you want from anything
I can see you so clеar
You can see your house from here
Almost at thе part
Where you tell your friends not to tell me what they know
Wouldn't you rather be alone?
Alone, alone, alone
And oh, baby, you're so green
You'd think you was made for me
All that fire, twenty-three
Blue light won't let me fall asleep
Left on read, it's heart-crushing
Scrolling through the numbers, think
Unlocking your phone
And you pull my name up subconsciously
My confidence, in love with it
It's so accursed, in love with this
My heart is, your heart with me
It's hopeless
Oh, 'cause, oh
Baby, you're so green
You'd think you was made for me
It's kind of dark
But what's a dream, if not made of memory?
Deep down you really want to go
You don't really care if I know
Calling all your friends 'cause
They never tell what you want from me
I can make me see it so clear (okay)
You can see your house from here (here)
Almost at the part
Where you tell your friends not to tell me, they know
Wouldn't you rather be alone?
Alone, alone, alone
Wouldn't you rather be alone?
Alone, alone, alone
(Ooh, well that was fun, oh)

So this is how I die now
Hands to the air
No, they can't stop the sky falling down, down
Guess I thought that I'd feel good somehow, how
When all you know is up, it's hard not to feel like you ain't going down, down
Disappearing through the silence
Screams fade and blur
Conversating with a smile, though
Life invisible
Guess I thought that I'd feel better now
Somehow, anyhow
So now
Icarus
No, I can't escape this fall
Falling in reverse
Falling in reverse
So how you gonna scream my name
When I gave all I got?
I've nothing left to give you
And I'm so burnt out and lost
'Cause it all just feels the same
And I got all I want
I had you where I wanted
I guess I don't know
How to live with a good thing
And not break it into nothing
Self destruct just to feel, or so it goes
One (Thank you so much, guys)
So tell me how you want me here now
Keep crying down the phone
Yeah, that's all I seem to hear now
Keep lying through your teeth
Lie to me, lie with me now
(I'm halfway there, but it's like, shit, I haven't really been doing anything for the last year. And it's insane that I've been doing a shit ton but like, in terms of... I don't know.)
So tell me how you really feel now
Ain't been asked that in a while
Yet you still hope that they'll hear you out
Just keep at it, bro, these things always seem to fix themselves somehow
Suck it up, some would kill just to stand
Where you're standing now
Icarus
No I can't escape this fall
So how you gonna scream my name
When I gave all I got?
I've nothing left to give you
'Cause I'm so burnt out and lost
'Cause fuck it, it all feels the same
And I got all I want
I thought that I'd feel something
Guess I'll never know
How to live with a good thing
Fucked my life up for nothing, nothing
'Cause you don't care if I'm still bleeding
You just scream until you hear my name
So this is how I die now
Hands to the air
No, they can't stop that sky falling down, down
Guess I thought that I'd feel good somehow
Disappearing through the silence
Screams fade and blur
Conversating with the smile, though
Life invisible
Guess I thought that I'd feel better now
Somehow, anyhow
By now

Concaving in the back

I don't think I knew
That I felt like I knew what I was doing
But I don't really remember
Feeling very scared about it
The water was cool, and you're shining
The windows were burning patterns in my mind
Running away was so tiring
Holding your stare, I felt miles behind
And how do you love when you're frightened?
The thought of me fucking up all these threads
Situations I know are just passing
I'm holding on for you, and static feel
The light ran down the wall, holding back the stars
Dividing us in new ways away from sleep
Confusion has its cost, wave pools in the dark
Crashing 'round my head
I don't think there was like, a happiest time
I feel like there are happy moments
The water was cool, and you're shining
The windows were burning patterns in my mind
Running away was so tiring
Holding your stare, I slip miles behind
And how do you love when you're frightened?
The thought of me fucking up all these threads
Situations I know are just passing
I'm holding on for you, and how to sleep
The light ran down the wall, holding back the stars
Dividing us in new ways away from sleep
Confusion has its cost, wave pools in the dark
Crashing 'round my head

I never had the guts to run away
Ever since sixteen, been dreaming of a brighter day
Out of control and out of everything
You came out the blue, or was it blue-gray?
Felt like waking up in a new place (New place, new place)
That stole the dark from the night
Shone a new way, ooh (New way, new way)
But I can feel your heartbeat rising
Even when you're ghost
And I can feel your every single movement
So, good morning (Good morning)
Good morning (Good morning)
Good morning
It's a good morning (Good morning, yeah)
Good morning (Good morning)
Good morn–
I felt like waking up in a new place, ooh (As day breaks mortality)
That stole the dark from the night (Colors run and bleed)
Shone a new way, yeah (New way, new way)
(For fear now's the only time there is)
But I can feel your heartbeat rising (And just as good night comes following)
Even when you're ghost (Follow down and seem)
And I can feel your every single move (I, who watched this disappear)
So, good morning (And out of the dark you'll find you)
Good morning
Good morning (Given the time and space)
It's a good morning
Good morning (The world will bend to guide you)
Good morning
I never had the guts to run away
(And just as good night comes following)
(And out of the dark you'll find you)
Ever since sixteen, been dreaming of a brighter day
(Follow down and seem)
(Given the time and space)
Out of control and after everything
(I, who watched this disappear)
(The world will bend to guide you)
You came out the blue

I was so heartless
I let my phone die
And carried it's carcass
Back home to the northside
From Paris, Texas
You called it all night
I knew, but of course I went looking
To not feel instant
Looking for something different
'Cause I don't want to feel like this my whole life
Urges warrant me
I just want your head on the wall
It don't mean nothing, oh
Don't it always end like this, in no time
I just want to chill
You just want my head on the wall
It don't mean nothing, oh
Now that my bro hit you
We could've done things
Kept talking about her
Chase both, you get nothing
Stop tryna resist it
Get out of my head
And new ink under the skin
And I called it something
To not feel instant
Been looking for something different
'Cause I don't want to feel like this my whole life
You're in love with me
And I just want your head on the wall
It don't mean nothing, oh
Don't it always feel like this, in no time
Tied up and carried away
It don't mean nothing
'Cause I'm dreaming of it
My heart beating away
Stop being a
It's hot, the stars

The morning light shines a lifeline
Escape is what I need
I should've listened last night, girl
This is beyond belief
That we keep falling for the lure of
Liquid confidence and lies
And we skydive from walls we built
Dying just to feel alive
On the way down screamin'
Woah, oh, oh
If all we have is time, then we'll be alright
Woah, oh, oh, woah, oh
It's not much, but it's better than nothing
Woah, oh, oh
We're running on fumes, but we'll make it through the night
Woah, oh, oh, woah, oh
It's not love, but it's better than dreaming
Oh, I'm on fire
There's a burning in my bones and in my eyes
These dreams, they're taking hold, I just need time
Time
Building walls to burn them down
Cannonballs to watch me drown
You've got me lost in here and now
You've got me gone and lost and found
We only hang in evenings
And I don't know what I'm thinking
But I know that I won't think it
If I keep up with this thinking
All these dreams and all these plans
We shared under the moonlight
They're dreams and plans that I have
I just don't know if you'll fit right
When I leave in the morning
And I kiss you and say goodnight
I kick myself until we kick it
Should've told you goodbye
Coming home so late at night
With clothes covered in sand
I don't know just what I'm missing
But I'm doing what I can
And if all we have is time then we will find
Boy you are in a hurry!
If you were lookin' at what I'm looking at you'd be in a hurry too
Woah, oh, oh
If all we have is time, then we'll be alright
Woah, oh, oh, woah, oh
It's not much, but it's better than nothing
Woah, oh, oh
We're running on fumes, but we'll make it through the night
Woah, oh, oh, woah, oh
It's not love, but it's better than dreaming
Woah, oh, oh
If all we have is time, then we'll be alright
Woah, oh, oh, woah, oh
It's not much, but it's better than nothing
Woah, oh, oh
We're running on fumes, but we'll make it through the night
Woah, oh, oh, woah, oh
It's not love, but it's better than dreaming

And if I told you how this story ends
Would you change a step you take?
And if I could relive all of my days
I'd live them all the same
'Cause I'm scared
Of all that I don't know
'Cause I want it all, but all of it ain't gold
And I'm scared
But I know it's not for long
'Cause I'm learning what I should've long before
That all we are
Is a light into the darkness
And all we are
Is time that's counting down
And all we are
Is falling through the spaces in between
Endless flight
A lifetime in repeat
But I still find solace
When you say
That you know how I feel
When it's wrong
And we ain't been right for years
And let go
Give these ghosts a new home
And let's bury our past and our fears and all these bones
And let's go
I should've seen it long before
'Cause this is my life
I will not run in circles
Ending where I start
So hold on to me
We'll burn out slowly
And feel our hearts leap
To words we don't mean
Love
Means nothing to me
'Cause I don't know what it is
I'm just dying to be
All that I've been dreaming of
And words betray me
Contradict all I stand for
But I'm still learning
Yeah, I'm still learning
That all we are
Is a light into the darkness
And all we are
Just time that's counting down
And all we are
Is falling through the spaces in between
Endless flight
We're falling to our knees

Wow, that sounds really cool and fun, yeah
Last dance, are you ready or not?
No chance that we make this out alive
I thought we could see a way out in time
But it got so dark, where'd the light go?
Talking so much, save the ozone
Saying nothing except to tell me it's late
So I wish you sweet dreams
If you want to sleep on me, yeah
No tears in the mornin'
It's alright, it's alright
It's all just sweet dreams
And you're sleeping on me
Even though it's not real
It's alright, it's alright
And by the time you wake up, I'm the other side of the river
Kept my face dry, don't say you feel diffеrent now
It's your loss, your loss, your loss
If you're lost
By the timе you wake up, wonder how it got so distant
Summertime skies feel different without me now
It's your loss, your loss, your loss
It's your loss, your loss, your loss
It's your loss, your loss, your loss (Yeah)
It's your loss, your loss, your loss, loss
You don't ask, you don't wanna find out
You're so sad when you don't get what you want
So tired of trying to change your mind, uh
Comme ci, comme ça, feelings come and go
Take what you want, feeling no remorse
Head on my chest, still so comfortable
So I wish you sweet dreams
If you want to sleep on me, yeah
No tears in the mornin'
It's alright, it's alright
It's all just sweet dreams
And you're sleeping on me
Even though it's not real
It's alright, it's alright (It's alright, it's alright)
And by the time you wake up, I'm the other side of the river
Kept my face dry, don't say you feel different now
It's your loss, your loss, your loss
If you're lost
By the time you wake up, wonder how it got so distant
Summertime skies feel different without me now
It's your loss, your loss, your loss
It's your loss, your loss, your loss
It's your loss, your loss, your loss (Yeah)
It's your loss, your loss, your loss, loss

The zipper broke
Now I can't open up my pocket
Your guard is up
So we just shadowboxing
They called it lost
But I still feel it in there somewhere
But my hands are cold
You said, "Then get out the snow, it's not difficult" (yeah)
She said do I believe in angels?
(Can't call it right now)
"Can't rely on what I can't see" (Too far to turn back)
(Can't see the night out)
"So why can't you tell me something?" (In this car there's no fighting)
(And no cares for missed timing)
"That doesn't feel like you're lying" (There's no blood, just psilocybin)
(We peace signing)
But my zipper broke
And I can't opеn up my pocket
I can't open up I know
It's all
Snow
Snow
That's all

Oh, we can figure it out
Navigate oceans on the ground, ground, ground
We can head out
I feel adventurous sometimes
Cannonball slow dive into night pools
Cold water's fine, fine, fine
I don't mind
Oh
I'm not stressing by way
Oh, we can figure it out
If you're stalling know I'm always down, down, down
We can hang out
I feel adventurous sometimes
Only bit me like most times but
I still jump 'cause for love I'm blind, blind, blind
For you I don't mind
'Cause I know
You'll be in my arms
One of these days I'm sure
And if it evaporates slowly
Laying in the streets in the soft Nеw York rain
Streets in the soft London rain
Streets in the soft LA rain
You're undеr my skin
Oh
I used to feel so high but my depth always lower(?)
So hard to say goodnight, night, night
You're still on my mind
The distances turns my stomach
Into knots whilst an ocean built a multitude of drafts
Wait for it to evaporate if I'm lost
'Cause I know
You'll be in my arms
One of these lives I'm sure
And if it evaporates I'll be
Out in the streets in the soft New York rain
Streets in the soft London rain
Streets in the soft LA rain
Soft on your skin
You're under mine
Hmm
Oh

I ran away last night, in my dreams
Oh, my dreams, they keeping me awake, yeah
Came crashing through the rain
Half light on a turnpike
One-forty make those guard rails float nice
I couldn't float right
Show me the way
To slow down, down, yeah
Slow down, down, down
Slow down, down
Slow, slow down
I found a way last night, in my dreams
Oh, my dreams, they keeping me awake, yeah
Came crashing through the rain
Half light on a turnpike
One-forty make those guard rails float nice
Learning to float right
Loving the wave
Loving the wave
Loving the—

Wise men say
Only fools rush in
But I can't help
Falling in love with you
Shall I stay?
Would it be a sin?
If I can't help
Falling in love with you
Like a river flows (Like a river flows)
Surely to the sea (Surely to the sea)
Darling, so it goes
Some things are made to be
Take my hand
Take my whole life too
For I can't help
Falling in love with you
For I can't help
Falling in love with you

And I'll break apart
Under my skin
Into my arms
Love at what cost
Eyes full of tears
Aim for the heart
Head in the dark
How am I supposed to know?
I'll break apart
Under my skin
Into my arms
Love at what cost
Eyes full of tears
Aim for the heart
Head in the dark
How am I supposed to know?
I know it's dark but it helps
I know it's dark but it helps
I know it's dark but it helps
I know it's dark but it's hell
I know it's dark but it hel-

sometimes
this could be anywhere in the world
sometimes i struggle to ask for the things i want
i feel like i'm getting in the way
sometimes it's easier not to speak
a lot of the time i feel like i'm standing inches from a jenny holzer
trying to let it tell me something
only seeing fragments without context
PROTECT ME FROM WHAT I WANT
how to escape a feeling that everything is quickly replaceable
trying to learn how to sway in the breeze when necessary
for periods i felt powerless
i switched up the texture, switched up the priorities
regained a feeling of control but was bittersweet i couldn't bring everyone with me
like a child acting out to test the limits of the love from their parents
even when the love is revealed to be resilient,
everyone's exhausted
now caught in limbo
trying to hold on to an old life in a new world
salary your friends or lose touch with them
everything that doesnt demonstrate material growth is a demonstrable failure
on an endless ladder what rung could possibly bring happiness anyway?
the more you try to stretch these moments out and live in them, the faster they will all slip behind you
in climbing we are brought to life
one step closer to feeling heard without speaking
and emerging from the doldrums where this could be anywhere in the world
to a foundational:
i was here, and this mattered to me
I’ve got a lot on my head tonight
ICYMI
I WAS IN LOVE

'Cause I had the best of the worst sides
And I had these lungs, ohh
And I had too many flashbacks
That I just let them burn
'Till my chest is on fire
And my head just won't die
I guess I'm lying 'cause I wanna
I guess I'm lying 'cause I don't
'Cause I just feel so tired
Like it's move or slowly die
You say, "You ain't you when you're like this
This ain't you and you know it"
But ain't that just the point?
You don't know how to let go
Who said this must be all or nothing?
But I'm so caught below, and I'll never let you know
No, I can't tell you nothing
'Cause I'm a fucking mess sometimes
But still I could always be
Whatever you wanted
But not what you needed
Especially when you been needing me
'Cause I'm a fucking mess sometimes
And I'll say what I don't mean
Just 'cause I wanted
Or maybe I need it
Swear lying's the only rush I need
'Cause all I needed was some words to say
That all these feelings don't mean shit to me
'Cause it's all just chemicals anyway, anyway, yeah
And I got way too many routes to take
To make this all just go away
And find another heart to break
So heartless with these words I say
Just saying what I'm supposed to say
'Cause I had nothing for you
I can't love when I can't even love myself
Things I would rather be thoughts at the back of my head
But I'm addicted to hurting
And I got these lungs
And I spent too many late nights
Just thinking a hole in the earth
'Till the sky is on fire
And my head still won't die
I guess I'm lying 'cause I wanna
I guess I'm lying 'cause I don't
'Cause I just feel so tired
Like I need something to come alive
She said, "You ain't you when you're like this
This ain't you, what you doing?"
And I said, "That's the point"
You don't know how to let go
Who said this must be all or nothing?
But I'm so caught below, and I'll never let you know
No, I can't tell you nothing
'Cause I'm a fucking mess sometimes
But still I could always be
Whatever you wanted, but not what you needed
Especially when you been needing me
'Cause I'm a fucking mess inside
And I'll say what I don't mean
Just 'cause I want it
Or maybe I need it
Swear lying's the only rush I need
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
Yeah, oh yeah, I need it
Yeah, I need it, I need it I need it, I need it, yeah

But she was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, "Oh mama, what do you mean I am the one?"
She said I am the one
She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Go and dance on the floor in the round
(I don't even know if I can tell you)
And the people always told me, be careful what you do
And don't you go round breaking young girls' hearts
My mother always told me, be careful who you love
And be careful what you do because a lie becomes a truth
And Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who thinks that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
For forty days and for forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand?
Her schemes and plans
So take my strong advice
(Don't think twice) Don't think twice
She told me, "Baby, we'd danced 'till three"
Then she looked at me
She showed me a photo of a baby crying
His eyes looked like mine
Go and dance on the floor in the round
People always told me, be careful what you do
And don't you go around breaking young girls' hearts
But she came and stood right by me
And she smelled of sweet perfume
And this happened much too soon
And she brought me to her room, yeah
And Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who thinks that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
But the kid is not my son
(Son)
She says I am the one

Life is just going so quickly, I can’t catch it
I don't think anyone can
I met the devil in the hills last night
I was driving by myself, alone
He said, "Boy, what you running from?"
I said, "I don't know"
I don't know if it was a better time
But girl, we were giants then
Endless nights, we were infinite (So, terrified, I guess)
Summer's end would mean the death of us
But summer past, and we grew up
And all of our paths, they split up
And I haven't seen your face or heard your voice in so long
So, so long
We had a good run, it's over now
(No, I'm not sad about it, but, I'm just, it's weird)
Yeah, lying on the grass, talk is so old
Living under Orion, we grew so bold
Lying on our days, we were outlaws
Our loss, but
Catch me if you can, never wiped out
Tryin' to catch a wave, tryin' to break out
I guess I didn't know
And now I'm gone
But it don't hurt me anymore
That's just the way it goes
Yeah, I should've known
But, I heard you talking through the walls late last night
"There are no ends, just grays and half-lives" (Left me in pieces)
Half-time (And I heard it), it's alright (And I heard it)
That summer past, and we grew up
And all of our plans, they split us up
And I haven't seen your face or heard your voice in so long
So, so long
We had a good run, it's over now
So, please, don't fade me out
So, please, don't fade me out
So, please, don't lose me now
I heard the words that you never said
Smokescreen from a cigarette
Exhale, we can never be what's in our heads
(So, please, don't fade me out)
Elevation doesn't matter now, it's straight ahead
Sending shivers down my spine, life pirouettes
It's cool, we're used to losing real friends
Only ever feeling it in retrospect
(So, please, don’t lose me now)
And we were really breathing, not silhouettes
Maybe in another dream this would never end
'Cause everything is not alright
And we are falling
But that's just life
Without some lows, there is no highs
And everything will be okay
Though we are all hurting
'Cause time flies fast
And you know, no pain is forever
Ever, forever
(I don't think, I'm not saying you should
Be really cautious and shit, I'm, quite the opposite
Just like it's, everything is so, I mean
Expecting anything to last forever is ridiculous isn't it?
I think that's ridiculous
You think that's ridiculous?
Yeah, of course everything lasts forever)

I could use a call and some old friends
The sky was on the floor, can't see no end, end
You said, "Where you been?", I said, "Nowhere"
Wish I could disappear like the oceans
Now I hate you  don't send no texts
When I close my eyes you move closer, yeah
Been trying to figure out where the hope went
Don't wanna talk about it in the past tense

(Locked, locked, lo-)
At least you cut me off slow
Your game gets heavy when my mind run
I saw your ghost in New York
Was lookin' for you on my shoulder
It's crazy (It's crazy)
I told you I was such a try hard
Knew it was never gonna last long
Callin' you up, you let me ring out
Nonstop
Guess you can only get part of what you want
I hear the disappointment seeping through the way you talk
And I was biding time, I should've held you in my arms
Tryna reach above for higher levels but they're locked
It's locked
It don't have to be this hard
Sabotage myself in style
It's so bittersweet when crushed
So I'm keepin' my feelings locked
Lockеd, locked, locked, locked
It's lockеd, locked
It's locked, locked, lo-
It's crazy
I told you I was such a try hard
Knew it was never gonna last long
Callin' you up, you let me ring out
Nonstop
Guess you can only get part of what you want
I hear the disappointment seeping through the way you talk
And I was biding time, I should've held you in my arms
Tryna reach above for higher levels but they're locked
It's locked
It don't have to be this hard (locked, locked)
Sabotage myself in style (locked, it's locked)
It's so bittersweet when crushed (locked, locked)
So I'm keepin' my feelings locked (locked, lo-)

I pulled off
No lies to divide my time
It wrinkles
Experiencing pain
What you are, Secrets
Are bouncing off the wall
No lie
No lie
We're hollow

Waves crashing over me
As light disappeared
Touch myself for some dopamine
What a fucking loser
I missed it bad but I hate it here
I'm out cried
Started to phoenix in Ashland
FaceTimed a blaze in slow motion
(Can you hear me?)
I watched it collapse in my palms
I been feeling the love I had fall
Through open arms
And bleeding out (I'm sick and tired)
I wish I made it back you know
We should've lasted years
Call it fate if it helps you
And let this go
I don't want the things I loved no more
It's cutting me up
Old friend, don't go
I don't wanna feel alone no more
It comеs and it goes, it comes and it goes
It comеs and it—
It comes and it goes
("You're not yourself anymore")
("You get up in the morning and that's the first thing you think about?")
("Sometimes I dream about it")
I saw your eyes in a dream last night
So used to not getting to say goodbye
Melting away with the changing light
You know you don't have to stay
I'll afterglow in the dark
Of course, the past can be changed
I watched it bend while I talked
The feelings all interchange
I feel you here when you're gone
And through it all
Let it fade if it helps you
And let this go
I don't want the things I loved no more
It's cutting me up
Old friend, don't go
I don't wanna feel alone no more
It comes and it goes
It comes and it goes, it comes and it—
It comes and it goes, it comes and it—
It comes and it goes, it comes and it—
It comes and it goes, it comes and it—
It comes and it goes, it comes and it—
It comes and it goes, it comes and it—
It comes and it goes, it comes and it—
It comes and it goes, it comes and it—
It comes and it goes, it comes and it—
It comes and it goes, it comes and it—
It comes and it goes, it comes and it—
It comes and it goes, it comes and it—
It comes and it goes, it comes and it—
It comes and it goes, it comes and it—
It comes and it goes, it comes and it—
It comes and it goes
How'd you like to see the world
How to hold you when it hurts?
Your eyes, they drift through hazy light
The cruelty of circumstance and time
I don't wanna wake you up
It's clear you'd rather be elsewhere
I'd rather be in love

Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Ooo, oh
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
There's nothing you can do that can't be done
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Nothing you can say, but you can learn how to play the game
It's easy, ooo
There's nothing you can make that can't be made
(Nothing you can't...)
There's no one you can save that can't be saved
(Saved...)
There's nothing you can do, but you can learn how to be you
It's easy, yeah
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love, love
Love is all you need
All you need is love
(Love, love, love)
All you need is love
(Love, love, love)
All you need is love
(Love, love, love)
Love is all you need
Love is all I need
Love is all I need
Love is all I need

I got a lot on my neck tonight
She want to crush until my atom's gone
If I could disappear, I'd do it tonight
Nothing surprises anymore, it's fucked
I think you know
I think you know and can't help it
I think you know
I think you know it don't matter
Don't matter
I got a map of my favorite cuts
Nothing can stop them from decaying away
I saw her text him from the crook of my arm
I still agree when they say we're all the same
And I think he knows
I think he knows and can't help it
And I think he knows
I think he knows it don't matter, matter
Don't matter
But this ain't working out
And I can't tell if it's real
And you can't hear me out
You can't, but I can't feel at all
And I think you know
I think you know
Don't matter, matter
And I think you know
I think you know, oh-oh

You keep open and closing your mouth
It's causing yours some more stress
'Cause you can't lay it to rest
And now there's pain in my chest it's your loss
Your loss, your loss
Your loss, your loss
Never one for revenge
But now that space in your bed feels hollow
And as you struggle to sleep
Something that could've been sweet is your loss

You came in through my window
You left without a sound
And floating through my ceiling
Eyes fixed on the ground
Am I holding you up?
A block in the road?
No words for a sinking life source
Telling you to go
'Cause we're just waiting on a signal, we're looking for a sign
Oblivious of changes, grasping at the tide
No hope in searching outward, no truth beyond the line
And melting at your edges, transmuting loss of time
Still wherever you go love will surround you
Love will surround you, love will surround you
Love will surround you
Am I holding you up?
A block in the road?
No words for a sinking life source
Telling you to go
'Cause we're just waiting on a signal, we'rе looking for a sign
Oblivious of changes, grasping at the tide
No hopе in searching outward, no truth beyond the line
And melting at your edges, transmuting loss of time
Still wherever you go love will surround you
Love will surround you
So let me go if you wanna
Don't let me know that I'm lost
'Cause I just wanna feel wanted
No revolution, no blood
Blood, blood, blood, blood
No hope in searching outward
No truth beyond the line
And melting at your edges
Transmuting lost time

I'm not—
(Wait, yeah)
I'm-
Second-hand smoke, fucking up my chest
Like you as you are, can you air my text?
I feel out of time
(Tick tock)
Closing in on space
(On space)
You've been in my head and not paying any rent
I got two more lives
( zero two )
I got seven spent
(I'm no—)
I found missing time, spending it
But it won't talk to me
How can I bridge the lie to who you are?
If it's how you are, it's true, it's true
I, I'd follow you down
Always down when you are
I love when you push it back
I miss how you used to talk back
And talk shit with me
So I keep staying up all night
Killing back some time
I keep thoughts of you
Thought loops
Whatever I want, woah
Am I still what it is you like?
I'll see you 'round some time
Bluе ticks, I'm a red light
Confused how to get right
Only comе through
When I'm better off without it
I don't want to be in love
I don't want to be in love no more
And dipping PS1 just to catch up on you
You've been M.I.A., but you text no different
I feel levels up and you don't know, don't care
For old time's sake, it's human nature
I feel it deep but shallow embraces, yeah
And dual SIM, said she phoning it in
I'm not convinced
I know someday some underpaid
Karma gon' come collect
Come out with it don't hold back
Things tend to balance through the madness
Fact is I heard that you've been
Staying up all night
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Revenge killing some time
(Tick tock)
Still I keep thoughts of you
Thoughts can do whatever I want, oh
Am I still what it is you like?
Yeah, yeah
See you all the time (Time)
Blue tick, you're a red light
Confused how to get right
Only come through when I'm better off without it
I don't want to be in love
I don't want to be in love no more
Peak sunrise from the hotel
And you were by my side
You stayed there the whole night
It's nothing, I don't wanna get devotional
You see what you wanna see

Jusqu'ici tout va bien
Jusqu'ici tout va bien
Ten tonne, ballast on my chest
As I woke up, a heavy inhale
For the nights you stole, oh
Fucked up, the balance in my head
But it's all good
I'll see you again another (Dream)
Oh
But I miss the way the sun streamed through my window
And I miss the way you almost held the tide
But still, it's nice, dreaming that you're somewhere
Feeling the same heat that I did
Another time (I know, I know)
If invisible lines lead your way back to me
Walk the line
I said I'd walk you home but we still went our own way
The tears lost in rain on your cheekbones in silence
And I pulled my head out the darkness in your house
Can't stay 'til the morning, refracted my way out
From nightmares in my car, as I lay beside you
And fucked up my timeline and twisted your end with
So much still to go, as the sun sets behind you
I can't let it go, you can't hold me
I can't always, oh
Talk it out
Cut me off
Chalk it down
To my head
Ba-balancing my head
Slow it down
Rise and fall
Chalk it down
To my head down
And I miss the way (Talk it out)
The sun streamed through my window (Cut me off)
And I miss the way (Chalk it down)
You almost held the tide (To my head)
But still, it's nice (Balancing my head)
Dreaming that you're somewhere (Slow it down)
Feeling the same heat that I did (Rise and fall)
No fear no fall (Chalk it down) (I know, I know)
If invisible lines lead your way back to me (To my head)
Still, I got nothing, woah
Comme les nuits quand je ne savais pas encore
Comme les nuits qui m'ont appris à aimer les adieux
Comme les nuits quand on croyait que tout irait bien
Mais cela n'a pas d'importance car les nuits
Bruyantes/brillantes
Bruyantes/brillantes
Bruyantes/brillantes
Sont toutes pareilles à la fin

Dancing on my own
My feet are drawn to you
And lost at every sound
My heart can't fade it
Mama said, “Why you gotta waste my time?”
I threw it to the wind, no line
It's something that I need, no crime
The call can't reconnect this time and
The substances we craved subsided
I never want to live half sided, no
Yeah, yeah, but still I persist on
I feel like we're orphaned
My halo got all bent
I hate how I feel and I'm falling
But I say nothing, I say nothing
No, I can't believe you wanted me
I cannot see the lining here
I fall asleep to sounds of dreams of you
You're losing me, losing me, don't lose me
Don't lose grip on me, feelings down on me
Heartbeats down on me, on me, on me
Staring at the screen but I feel no way
Bleeding through to real life, fucking up the wave
I can make you feel, but could never make you stay
What do you want from me?
What do I hope to see?
I haven't been home in weeks
Still, I can feel loved for now
And I can accept the paths I've taken
And if all this dies out I'll be good
Still, I'm down and
Da- dancing on my own
My feet are drawn to you
And lost at every sound
My heart can't fade it

Yeah, ooh-ooh
I'm not sad
When you told me you don't feel bad
Walls up, I don't feel myself
When you try to climb up now
Try to climb up now
Yeah, is it enough for you now?
I couldn't run from you
We can start it up
I feel it rough when you're far above now
Is it enough for you now?
I proved them wrong
When you're weighing down
I couldn't fall for you now
I walk on
Walk on water to get mountain waters
Is it enough for you now?
I couldn't run from you
We can start it up
I feel it rough when you're far above now
Is it enough for you now?
I proved them wrong
When you're weighing down
I couldn't fall for you now
I walk on
Walk on water to get mountain waters
By my side

What are you gonna sing for us?
I'm gonna sing Friday Night, which is my original song
What's it about?
It's about Friday Night
Baby, it's Friday
I'm with my friends
And we're just having fun
Right now, I feel amazing
And when it's the time, would've been my time
Maybe I want to die, maybe I don't
Knowing when to stop, and I can't stop
You had me falling through
I feel you calling it amazing
It's not love if it's just burning up
You don't care how I feel about it
It's not love, you can call it blurred
Just don't care, don't care
Yeah-yeah
She said I'm lying
This must mean more, you know
Fuck all of your friends
After a while, I get so bored
With all that self obsession
We say the same things on repeat
'Til there's a truth in the day
I've been herе since 2016
I can't relate to my friеnds
She said I'm lying
This must mean more, you know
Fuck all of your friends
After a while, I get so bored
With all that self obsession
I say the same thing on repeat
'Til there's a truth or it's dead
I've been here since 2016
I can't relate to my friends
She just wanted to say that she miss me, yeah
We've been wanting the same since 2015, yeah
I've been running some games
You can miss me, yeah
You can miss me, yeah
It's not love if it's just burning up
You don't care how I feel about it
It's not love, you can call it blurred
Just don't care, don't care
Missed out, what you gonna say?
Know you get sad, and you already stayed, ay
Get far, know we're gonna stay, ay
Know you're gonna stay, ay
I know we got something
I know when you're sleeping
I know when you get sad
You're thinking of me, yeah
Thinking of me, yeah
Just wanted to tell you, it's mutual
Wanted to tell you, it's mutual
Got so used to-
Amazing
It's not love if it's just burning up
You don't care how I feel about it
It's not love, you can call it blurred
Just don't care, don't care
She said I'm lying
This must mean more, you know
Fuck all of your friends
After a while, I get so bored
With all that self obsession
I say the same thing on repeat
'Til there's a truth or it's dead
I've been here since 2016
I can't relate to my friends

So hold on if you want
I don't wanna play this, no
I don't have the patience
And last year was a long one
And these days are reruns
A fine time for a breakdown
Let's find words to tear these walls down
And I threw them all away
If I start then I probably won't stop
'Cause the world moves on and the lights stay on
For the next one, and next one, it's an ocean
No, I don't wanna waste forever
But I can if I want to
There's so much that can change my mind
So much of me has changed, how could I ever feel the same?
So dive in, to my home
It's all I have, woah (Coming up for the weekend, running as far as we can)
So drive me, 'till the shore
Spoken like a real life savior
NASCAR, we're just racing in circles again
(We'll get it right for the next time)
Bleed out, it's a cold night
City views killed the starlight
Sleeping at the wheel for the first time
It's terrifying when you wake up
A few years later it's a new time
Hard to see how it stands from the inside
Inside, it's tried if it's tiring
You then, leave
So dive in, to my home
(Cassini don't come home, you don't want to say it)
It's all I have, woah (And I don't want to know, but I feel it, I feel)
(Coming up for the weekend, running as far as we can)
So drive me, 'till the shore
(And I don't want to be here, but I don't want to go)
Spoken like a real life savior ('Cause I need it)
NASCAR, we're ju–
The lone and level sands stretch far away

One, two, three
Yeah, she's in love with the concept
As if we're all just how she imagined
'Cause we're in love, I just don't know it yet, huh
Well, tell me how am I supposed to see the magic?
'Cause I don't believe in it no more
But I won't tell her
'Cause I always imagined
It's easier if she thinks she won
So I'ma let her, and she said
"I don't think I love you no more
You never seem to call me lately"
Girl, I don't think you know me at all
'Cause I never thought I'd have to say this
No I don't love you, and I never did
Look at us burning down in flames for kicks
But just know
I'm not singing for your XO
I'm just singing 'cause it's over, yeah
Uh
Yeah
Came and went like the summertime
Was that a sunset or sunrise?
Looking back like, "Where'd the time go?"
So much for trying to keep this moving slow
'Cause I don't believe in her no more
But I remember
How we talked shit like we knew what we wanted
I still remember what she said
"I don't think I love you no more
You never seem to call me lately"
But I don't think she knew me at all
'Cause I never thought I'd have to say this
But I'm no liar, and I never hid anything
You should've seen it coming to this
Just know
I'm not singing for an ex, though
I'm just singing 'cause it's over, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh
Uh, girl I'm just singing
I'm just singing, yeah
I'm just singing 'cause it's over

I want to go
Yeah
I was looking for your face in the prequels
That keep running through my mind when it's idle
I know you never had the time for my sci-fi's
But, you loved shapeshifting
And I know we were high, but I meant it
I'm not tryna fuck about, if it looks it
I told her, "Now is not the time"
I'm just dancing and ghost erasing
Oh, but I remember that sunset like it was last night
Fireworks blowing holes in the night sky
She told me, "Baby, now or never"
I didn't know what it was for a long time
But it was you for so long on my mind
I know we're breaking
But I just wanna hear your voice in the morning (yeah)
'Cause I been up waiting for something that's hopeless
I don't really wanna break your heart when it's open
Like finding out love's not a feeling it's a choice, oh-woah-oh
I miss home
You want me to tell you
I've always hated dancing
But I would dance with you
Oh, and I can see right through you, babe
Know you'd love me if I told you
That I'm in love with you
Oh, but I remember that sunset like it was last night
Fireworks blowing holes in the night sky
She told me, "Baby, now or never"
I didn't know what it was for a long time
But it was you for so long on my mind
I know we're breaking
But I just wanna hear your voice in the morning
'Cause I been up waiting for something that's hopeless
I don't really wanna break your heart when it's open
Like finding out love's not a feeling it's a choice, oh-woah-oh
You want me to tell you (Ooh, ooh)
I've always hated dancing (Ooh)
But I would dance with you (Ooh, ooh)
Oh, and I can see right through you, babe
You would love me if I told you (Oh, ooh)

Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh–
And we looked like a slasher film
Playing out of sequence
Baby, it's just feedback
Looping up my demons
Told them if I'm gonna die it's with you
But you were like the breeze when it's one hundred-three
Felt like if we don't sleep then tomorrow's just a dream
Oh I hope they don't find us, tonight
If time could stand still
If I could change
Maybe I'd have found the words
To tell me, to tell you, to say
I could have stayed here forever
And we look like a slasher film
Cut up out of sequence
Running from a crime scene
Baby, I'm still bleeding
And I can never go back, yeah
I just want you to know that
I've been staring at the ceiling
Looking for a breach
Even in the silence, I can hear you say
The end's just seconds away
But if time could stand still
If I could change (Ooh)
Maybe I'd have found the words (To tell you)
To tell you that
I feel like I could puke my guts up
If they weren't already on the floor
I feel like I'm losing grip on, and on
And you can grab my hand as we run off
Maybe we'll make it after dawn
But in the sunlight, we'll be different (Different)
If time could stand still
If I could change
And maybe I'd have found the words
To tell you, to tell you, to say
I could have stayed here fore–
Ooh, ooh, ooh–

Am I holding you up?
From problems below?
No effort to sing

Speaking of another life
I can't unfold our
Heartbreak from another time
Four seconds too long
In my head I get caught, by smokes
Just wishing I won't let her mind
Alright
So we can fly away
Wondering way out loud 'till my thoughts say so
Just to ride the wave
I think I move too fast, enough to take it slow
'Cause I'll just keep running, tripping, falling
Running, tripping, falling
And I just keep running, tripping, falling
Running, tripping, running, tripping
I just keep running, tripping, falling
Running, tripping, falling
But maybe I'll get somewhere, fast, fast
'Cause speaking of another lie, just to make times last
'Cause speaking of another love died, all just typecast
Say I fall in love too fast
For my own good
Good, good, good
We can run away
I'll move 'till I die, enough to take it slow
Just to ride the wave
We're moving too fast, enough to take
'Cause I just keep running, tripping, falling
Running, tripping, falling
And I just keep running, tripping, falling
Running, tripping, running
And I just keep running, tripping, falling
Running, tripping, falling
But maybe I'll get somewhere, fast, fast

You came in through my window, you left without a sound
You’re floating through my ceiling, eyes fixed on the ground
Am I holding you up?
A block in the road, no effort to sinking
Life’s always telling you to go
'Cause we’re just waiting on a signal, we’re looking for a sign
Oblivious to changes, grasping at the time
No hope in searching outward, no truth beyond the line
Melding at your edges, transmuting lost time
Still wherever you go
Love will surround you
Love will surround you
Love will surround you
Love will surround you
Am I holding you up?
A block in the road, no effort to sinking
Life’s always telling you to go
'Cause we’re just waiting on a signal, we’re looking for a sign
Oblivious to changes, grasping at the time
No hope in searching outward, no truth beyond the line
Melding at your edges, transmuting lost time
But still wherever you go
Love will surround you
Love will surround you
So let me go if you wanna
Don’t let me know that I’m lost 'cause I just wanna feel wanted
No revolution, no blood, blood, blood, blood
(No hope in searching outward)
(No truth beyond the line)
(Melding at your edges, transmuting lost time)

This short 2 minute song can be seen as an interlude on the EP marking the transition between “drugs” and “rock+roll”.
And this is just another sad song
I can't deny that I've been needing one
And that the world is always at fault
And we did nothing, how did we do wrong?
And I've been thinking that when we thought
The world would break us that we weren't wrong
But it's just never been the world outside
And sonder kinda has me terrified
And I'm so sorry I can't find the time
Spent all my days over-preoccupied
And I've been thinkin' 'bout how I'd react
If you were me and I was ghosted out
And I know I should try more
But I've been so caught in my own small shit that I can't see
Past the nothing around me here
But I've been trying really fuckin' hard not to try so hard
Really fuckin' hard to just let go
Really fuckin' hard not to try so hard
And realize I've nowhere left to go

Fucking hell, man
(Okay, ready now?)
(Yes)
I couldn't wait to leave that town
It broke my heart
I had to go (Shit)
I made a choice
To see this out I lost it all
You didn't show
All you wanted was some violent form of love
Immolate me (Oh Lord)
All I was looking for was colours blurred
And words that I'd forget
And now I'm singing
"Slow down
Keep those feet on the ground
I hope you'll be home soon"
Somehow we'll figure out how to cope
This is nothing we can't
There is nothing we can't do, right
You lost your voice, you couldn't sing
You couldn't talk about it
I stood and watched
The summer shone, rain down our backs
We didn't care
It was enough
All you wanted was some violent form of love (Love!)
Immolate me, woah (Violence, violent)
All I was looking for was colours blurred
And nights that I’d forget
And now I'm singing
"Slow down
Keep your feet on the ground
I hope I'll be home soon"
Somehow we figured out how to cope
This is nothing we can't
There is nothing we can't do
Right?
Oh Lord
What a night, what a night
What a Saturday night
Lord what a night, what a night
What a Saturday night
Everybody come feel up, feel up
What their muma no bring
Everybody come feel up, feel up
What their muma no bring
Oh Lord
What a night, what a night
What a Saturday night
Lord what a night, what a night
What a Saturday night
(Aww)

I don't follows fighting for a lost cause
Feel like even drifting we're just off course
Or is it no good?
What are we if dying for?
What are we lying for?
Oh, if it's no good?
Good, what would you call it?
Yeah
Mind if I don't end this dying
(I don't follows fighting for a lost cause)
If it's worth it, you would know
(Feel like even drifting, we're just off course)
Oh, it stops, all the faking, it's all fire
No flame can absolve sin
Oh, it's nothing, I'll get sullen, when I get sober
Despite my best, you keep calling
You got something I don't want to miss out on
I don't leave you over your stead
Would you call that love?
Love, love, love, you call that love?
Love, love, love, would you call that love?
Love, love, love, all that love, love, love, love

Rush away
I can't see us coming down soon
I can't see the sun from this room
But I know that it's setting somewhere
Rituals holding us moments from ruin
Replaceable chords on a loop
I'm thumbing through lives
Interchangeable yous
But I can't keep checking my phone
I can't keep checking my phone (I just want you)
For what you won't say
But I want you to know
Don't want you to change for me
Yeah, honestly
Rushing things
Small talk in deafening rooms
Perpetual motion ensues
And you're never there
When I'm not around
I can't keep checking my phone
I can't keep checking my phone (I just want you)
For what you won't say
But I want you to know
Don't want you to change for me
These lines complete
Though I loved it here, honestly

I wanted you to be the last thing on my mind
I wanted you to be the reason I close my eyes
But I can't sleep and, oh, God, I wanted to be your high
But everything I said went unheard
And everything you saw with eyes straight blurred became our downfall
'Cause you say I drink, and I smoke, and I talk too much
But I know, you lie when you said, "You just gotta go and save yourself"
So hear me out
You know, everybody talks, girl, and it means nothing 'til you let it
But if you keep second-guessing, then there's only gonna be one end
You can leave if you really want to
And you can run if you feel you have to
Now, I'll be fine if you ever ask me
I know it's hard, but no one said it's easy
Falling's easy, but there's only one way up
So I've been thinking that I think too much
And I can't sleep, but I can dream of us
And I've been seeing shit like horror cuts
It's burning down, I gotta drown this out
And you said, you need me to let this go
But it's who I am, or am I just losing it?
'Cause you said, "Jump," and I went first
But falling's always been my downfall
And you say I drink, and I smoke, and I talk too much
But I know, you lie when you said that you just had enough and, "Save yourself"
So hear me out
You know everybody talks, girl, and it means nothing 'til you let it
And if you keep second-guessing, then there's only gonna be one end
But you can leave if you really want to
And you can run if you feel you have to
And I can drink if I feel I have to
I know it's hard, but I can't feel like I used to
Like I used to
'Cause I used to defy gravity, defy gravity
Goodbyes keep dragging me down
And I'm fighting gravity, defying gravity
And I try, but I keep falling
'Cause falling's easy, but it only brings you down

Sur la Terre, tout est joli
Tout est joli
Speaking of another life
Rooftop convos, backstory of tattoos, I can't imagine
I contact fast, high hopes got dashed and you called me up
I can't believe my luck
The ghost I love's in love with someone else and he doesn't know about us
And now he's fading away (now he's fading away)
I feel something (now he's fading away)
He's fading away
(He's fading away)
But can I make you see, you belong with me
Don't you know you're throwing it away, throwing it away, throwing it-

Sometimes I'm a shell, but it doesn't mean
I just wanna throw it all away, throwing it away, throwing it-
Throwing it away, throwing it away, throwing it-
Throwing it away, throwing it away, throwing it-
Caught within the air, slow motion
Caught me feeling something strange, it's a cold ocean
I heard a friend showing me new ways
I had a dream, there was no escape
You got me back in your own ways
I have come at a dead space
I feel now you saw you chose this
Honest, we had a couple , and a couple years showing new sides of familiar faces
We could've  thinking
But can I make you see, you belong with me

Tu sais que la vie, elle est belle, mais on voit plus la vie quand on meurt. Du coup c'est un peu triste il faut en profiter de la vie. La vie c'est joli, c'est beau, on peut voyager, chanter, rigoler...
Sur la Terre, tout est joli
Il y a plein de choses qui sont jolies: les chansons douces, les bébés, tout ça c'est chouette du coup il faut en profiter . Mais c'est chouette d'avoir des copains sur la Terre, après quand on meurt on les voit plus c'est triste...
Oui mais il y a des méchants partout
Oui mais il y a des méchants partout?
Ils ont des pistolets ils peuvent nous tirer dessus parce qu'ils sont très très méchants
C'est pas grave ils ont des pistolets mais nous on a des fleurs
Oui mais les fleurs ça fait rien...
Mais si regarde, tu vois si on pose des fleurs c'est pour combattre les pistolets
C'est pour protéger?
-Voilà
Et les bougies aussi?
C'est pour ne pas oublier les gens qui sont partis avant nous
C'est pour nous protéger les fleurs et les bougies?
Oui. Ca va mieux du coup?
Sur la Terre tout est joli

Music softly playing
In an Uber through the park
Don't you say it
Hated someone dissing in the dark
I'll go by myself when I'm feeling it
Talk shit while we're playing
And it's breaking my heart
Walking in another time
Like this one's getting old
But looking out, out forever
Watch the sun come up
From the Star-Wars side
You been MIA since 2015
Oh yeah
'Cause I could, I move on my feet
Called you when I was in need
No reply, it's just something that I'm used to
Moon-walking's something that you used to do
Bathing in the day, woah
While the pools resurface
Can you catch me now?
Can you talk me down?
I don't feel alive when I see you no more
Caught me by surprise one time, now I know
That's on you now, you owe me that
You were all I had one time
Now I've come so far
You been MIA since 2015
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Don't come back for me
Don't confuse happiness and feeling loved
Won't keep waiting if it's killing me
Been tryna disappear
And it kept breaking my heart
Love is always free
Even just an inch away from blowing up
And if you say it one time
You can't even find out how you want it
Can you catch me now?
Can you talk me down?
I don't feel alive when I see you no more
Caught me by surprise couple times, now I'm sure
That's on you now, you owe me that
You were all I had one time
Now I've come so far
You been MIA since 2015
Oh yeah
'Cause I could, I move on my feet
Called you when I was in need
No reply, it's just something I got used to
Moon-walking's something that you used to do
Misused, I miss you, I missed you, yeah

I know one of these days
We gotta cross paths that we can't retrace
Spent a couple years braced
I wonder what we'd say if we saw here where we started from
You're all fucked up
You're all fucked up
You gotta calm it down
And she said, "Is this it?"
I was waiting for something
Always thought that I would get out
Dreamed that I would get out
But it feels like this is it
I did everything I could
And it still slipped into thin air
I was holding it then I wasn't
Sensational, you know I felt it coming
But if you close those eyes
It's always still there, always still
Lighting up the screen, syncing in the dark
Fighting back tears trying to make it stop
But you keep fucking with me
You keep fucking with me
You keep fucking with me
And it feels like this is it
I was waiting for something
I always thought that I would get out
Always dreamed that I would get out
But it feels like this is it
I did everything I could
And it still slipped into thin air
And I was holding on, ooh
It make me want to cry
You want to really make me cry sometimes
And in the moment I faced up
I felt love fade out
Can't you see it?
I'm trying
I don't even know how I can tell you this

I've been holding flowers
While you're texting me
And I can't wait for you
Rushing me to hard nights
Stuck in my head, girl
I can't wait for it
And it feel like you follow me
Like, "Oh, Twin Shadow"
Second I'm free
You're pulling me right back down
And I love the way you know how it feel
And I love the days your love could still heal
And dot all the ways
Your love could break my guard back down
So if you're gonna stay around
Tell me, is you down?
If we're falling in
You gotta go one last time
From out from me
'Cause I've been talking so long
I don't know if you even know I'm here
And you can call it if you want
Four SIMs, no, I don't roam
Gold digits on my phone
Five-digits on your throat
Ghost me, I don't care
Got my own confiding cell
Now, lеt them sync up
Now, let them sync up
So, tеll me how you feel about it?
And talking always make it less quiet
Baby, we're just syncing up
We're sinking like a cannonball
And tell me how you feel about it
And talking always make it less cloudy
Baby, we're just syncing up, yeah
We're sinking like a cannonball
And I love the ways you know how it feel
And I love the days your love could still heal
And dot all the ways
Your love could break my guard back down
So if you're gonna stay around
Tell me, is you down?
Down

Oh, we can figure it out
Navigate oceans on the ground, ground, ground
We can head out
I feel adventurous sometimes
Cannonball slow dive in to night pools
Cold waters fine, fine, fine
I don't mind
Ouu
And I'm not stressing by the way
Oh we can figure it out
If you're stalling know I'm always down, down, down
We can hang out
I feel adventurous sometimes
Only bit me like most times but
I still jump 'cause for love I'm blind, blind, blind
I don't mind
'Cause I know
You'll be in my arms
One of these days I'm sure
Even if it evaporates slowly
Out in the streets in the soft New York rain
Streets in the soft London rain
Streets in the soft LA rain
You're under my skin
I used to feel so out of my indefinite time
So hard to say goodnight, night, night
You're still on my mind
The distance turns my stomach Into knots
What's an ocean but a multitude of drops
I'll wait for them to evaporate if I'm lost
'Cause I know
You'll be in my arms
One of these nights I'm sure
And if it evaporates I'll be
Out in the streets in the soft New York rain
Streets in the soft London rain
Streets in the soft LA rain
Soft on your skin
You're under mine

I feel no certain way performing
With foreign strings and final season growth
Oh, I can't find you
And I don't know if I want to
I can't find you
And I don't know
And worst won't follow the meaning
As lies don’t find
It's seeming that words don't fall
As easy as I wanted them to
And if the center of all is nothing
Then I'm sure we'll meet again
'Cause as the sun, it sets in circles
In elliptical faces in darkness, I know
I don't

I know one of these days
We gotta cross paths that we can't retrace
Spent a couple years braced
I wonder what we'd say if we saw here where we started from
You're all fucked up
You're all fucked up
You gotta calm it down
And she said, "Is this it?"
I was waiting for something
Always thought that I would get out
Dreamed that I would get out
But it feels like this is it
I did everything I could
And it still slipped into thin air
I was holding it then I wasn't
Sensational, you know I felt it coming
But if you close those eyes
It's always still there, always still
Lighting up the screen, syncing in the dark
Fighting back tears trying to make it stop
But you keep fucking with me
You keep fucking with me
You keep fucking with me
And it feels like this is it
I was waiting for something
I always thought that I would get out
Always dreamed that I would get out
But it feels like this is it
I did everything I could
And it still slipped into thin air
And I was holding on, ooh
It make me want to cry
You want to really make me cry sometimes
And in the moment I faced up
I felt love fade out
Can't you see it?
I'm trying
I don't even know how I can tell you this

It's been a few years since you been gone
There's been a few tears, but that was years and years ago
Yeah, I grew up to be exactly what you wanted
Yeah, I've been living out the dream that you dreamt up
It's been a few years with more to come
It's been a few years since I've felt sure of what I want
And I woke up today and found that you were waiting here for me and I thought
Woah, old friend, it's bittersweet
But how could you do this to me?
How could you do this to me?
Yeah
'Cause you are not who you think you are
There's no grain on these brown eyes
But they can be green if they really want
And I can bend your words
So they say exactly what hurts the most
But silence is better than fake laughs or faking we're always up
Loose grip
The world bends around you
And living through cracked screens
We fold down to what we want
Out of love
We talk through lines, we're made of smoke
And just in time, we drift away
Diffusing light, confusing times
Growing up, or cascading down?
Cascading down
I'm hurting now
But change comes slow
If you hate what's in your head, the fuck would you speak your mind?
In search of lost time
Just 21, so I'm young and I'm stupid
Only 16, yeah, I think you should've known
I think you fucked me up
I think, I think you fucked me up
And I've got nothing to say to you
It's been a few years and I moved on
Couldn't make it disappear, oh I tried so hard to be strong
But I grew up today and faced that I'm not just lonely
Don't feel much better but I guess that it's a start

Ooh, I could stay here for some time
Open Pandora's box, and scroll a while
Flash cuts through rave like lightning strike
(I hate losing my cool)
I hate losing my cool, love losing my mind
Tears in the booth, if it was Pyrrhic I could never tell (Oh, oh)
When I dream of you, do you see me as well?
If they don't really care, I don't really wanna know
Carry versions of you every single way I go
Waiting on a world that was never gonna show
But I don't want to get stuck in my ways
I haven't seen the stars in so lo-
I don't want to get stuck in my ways
I haven't seen the stars in so long
So you're using us
You only come back when you have something to promotе, is that safe as to say?
Yeah
Well, I mеan...
What about just coming because you kind of enjoyed the experience?
Well, all right, okay
Will you come back?
I'll come back sometimes and hang out with you
No, I didn't say hang out
Do me a favor-
I'm gonna, I'm gonna...
Wait a minute, listen to me!
Hey
Hey all, we'll be right back with Smash Mouth



You been confusing since the day I met you
Another night chasing, this feels like home
Since I've been miles away, no change
Outsider inside looking dazed
Just wash the glitter off your face and go home
Winter sun throwing shadows long and lonesome
How strange to think that we were strangers once
At square one
I guess it's on me, I want more than I've got
But I can't ask you for the things you don't feel
Don't—
'Cause I don't want no fake love, fake love, fake love
I don't wanna know no fake friends, forced smiles, or favors
And I don't wanna know no fake love, fake love, fake love
Just say what you wanna say, yeah
And I'll still be there
It's easy when you've nothing to lose
And I'll still be there
'Cause I've got nowhere else, yeah
Yeah, she told me love me fast but take it slow
I said I'm going nowhere fast as hell
And keeping with the times we gotta keep it on the low
Midnight habits burning through the summer since the snow, and
I finally feel myself again
It's been so long, I thought I'd seen the end
But I guess you need ends to begin again
And again, and again
'Cause this is nothing we ain't seen before
I lived through it, I ain't overdosed
The sky is falling like it always does
So I guess we'll see if someone's watching over us
So let it rain
The clouds look heavy, but they bear no weight
The scars can't hurt you and the bruises will fade, yes
And I don't want no fake love, fake love, fake love
I don't wanna know no fake friends, forced smiles, or favors
And I don't wanna know no fake love, fake love, fake love
Just say what you wanna say
And I'll still be there
It's easy when you've nothing to lose
And I'll still be there
'Cause I've got nowhere else
And I don't want no fake love, fake love, fake love
I don't wanna know no fake friends, forced smiles, or favors
And I don't wanna know no fake love, fake love, fake love
Just say what you wanna say, yeah



I never had the guts to run away
Ever since sixteen, been dreaming of a brighter day
Out of control and out of everything
You came out the blue, or was it blue-gray?
Felt like waking up in a new place (New place, new place)
We stole the dark from the night
Shone a new way, ooh (New way, new way)
But I can feel your heartbeat rising
Even when you're a ghost
And I can feel your every single movement
How fast the light died out
We lost track of ourselves, riding the wave (Woah)
At last, the time will run out
Waited for us, don't you lose it now (You gave up, yeah)
Don't you lose me now

You do it again, you do it again
Alright
Baby I'm exhausted
Do it again
It rained and poured I know
I sometimes ask too much
Slip in and out of touch
I feel you
Good get lost
It's not love, it's just burning up
You don't care how I feel about it
It's not love, you just
Just don't care yeah
It's not love, it's just burning up
Don't care how you feel about it
It's not love,
Don't care yeah, care yeah

I was looking for you in the garden
The shadows under the trees perforated night skies
I found it hard to see in the glare
The only response to a call was the rustle of leaves, birdsong
Your name diffusing through the undulations in the air
The kitchen doors were open
I checked the fridge before continuing
Skipping stairs was a stretch but still a habit
Years later, a couple lanes away from where we lived
I watched an asteroid break up on entry
Bright limbs streaking across a black sky
What were the chances?
Miracles unfolding overhead
Drinking in the park
I could never explain the pit in my stomach
Frantic, nervous pacing through the house
If we act like things are not spiraling out of hand
Does that make them so?
If a thought goes unspoken, does that erase it?
The unbroached belief when my friend died decades later, that subconscious echoes carried him through me
But it never rears its head when it can be reasoned with
The world ends on a quiet weekend
Not through diagnoses, emergencies, collapses
Although I hate thinking that memories bend
Cars are still parked outside
If the rapture had happened, why was it unrecognizable?
Why is the sky blue?
Why did no one tell me?
Did these things not announce themselves?
And when I found you, you told me to wash my hands
I had been playing outside
And spoke nothing of the end of the world
Does that mean it never happened?

I saw the Northern Lights at nineteen
Pathfinding in the sky and staying up like that shit easy
Feeling I might call and make a mill' just like it's easy
Why should I save a world that would never save me?
And I've been burning both ends
Like I'm trying to see the end of time
Fucking like we fell in love with wasted life
What you waiting for?
We won't always feel this good
Waiting for?
Yeah, how would the right time grant what you want?
Don't you want to feel right standing on your ones?
On your ones
Yeah, (yeah)
It's just how I feel sometimes
I told you it's gon' be alright
But I only hear about you through friends now
(I only hear about you through friends now)
I didn't feel the time slip by
I didn't know that was a last goodbye
I guess we are who we are 'til we're not
(All good friends give good head)
(We don't wanna hear it)
(You were here so-)
And with my arms 'round my friends
'Til the bitter end
I don't really care
(I don't really need-)
What you really said
(Didn't know that was a last goodbye)
I can break my heart by myself
Guess we are who we are 'til we're not
(And I don't wanna feel like I'm reaching)
If it keeps going how it's been then we're gone
(Don't really care)
And if it's all in my head (In a minute)
I made peace with it
I'm still myself in the morning
()
I been waking up with a new friend
(I hate to not feel my love)
And they boyfriend and his new friends
(Yeah, oh)
So what you waiting for?
Build me up, I can't feel this enough
I called your bluff, I don't care if you walk this time
I don't wanna feel like I'm reaching
I don't wanna feel like I'm reaching
But it's just how I feel sometimes
I told you it's gon' be alright
I only hear about you through friends now
(Waiting for)
I didn't feel the time slip by
(Build me up)
I didn't know that was a last goodbye
I guess we are who we are 'til we're not
(What you waiting for?)
It's just how I feel some times
I told you it's gon' be alright
But I only hear about you through friends now
I didn't feel the time slip by
Didn't know that was a last goodbye
Guess we are who we are 'til we're not
And I don't wanna feel like I'm reaching
I don't want it

Shuffle in the dark, I'm throwing out parts and time
Is always changing, particles spin down
Separated lust, yeah, couple seconds up
You want something that ain't coming back to that
But it really don't matter how bad you want me
How you found me, I can't keep up with//afford just
Being a static design

And honestly, I can't sleep no more
On film it's dark but it's only reconstructing light that don't shine no more
I can't help but dream of nights, I can't live no more
The feelings die and she don't sleep in my arms no more, yeah
But I'll get right in a little bit, I'll find my light in the little bits
Passed out on my bedroom floor, I'll get back up
I lost my mind when I needed it
Yeah, it's so sad, what we had was never enough for us
Just echoes and dust
Just saying, if you want it, go find it
I'm just saying, if you want it, go find it
Just saying, if you want it, go find it, just saying
Yeah, self-division in the dark
You were a multi-colored vision (Yeah)
Versions of another version fell apart, high speed
Halide lifting silver linings from the dark
And it's just starting to sink in, I ran through the morning
When the light showed me nothing I didn't know before
So close, but you say we're better off, I leave the curtains drawn
I don't think you understand how we're splitting the loop
A last impression of you, I left some time ago
So how you gon' catch me now? (Fuck it all up)
Woah, these waves just keep ringing out
So slowly, I watched it burn
So slowly, yeah
All the things that we love tie us up
Just echoing love
(Slowly, I watched it burn)
I'll get right in a little bit, I'll find my light in the little bits
Passed out on my bedroom floor, I'll get back, get back up (So slowly)
I lost my mind when I needed it, yeah
Yeah, it's so sad, but what we had was never enough for us
(All the things that we love tie us)
Just echoes and dust
Just saying, if you want it, go find it
I'm just saying, if you want it, go find it
Just saying, if you want it, go find it, just saying
How fast the light died out
We lost track of ourselves in riding the wave (Woah)
At last, the time of our lives
Waited for us, don't you lose it now
(You gave up, yeah)
Don't you lose me now

Baby, yeah
Baby, baby
Nineteen (Baby!)
Inverted baby
Bright blue sky scenes, obscura in my bedroom
Lying on the floor, we had some times
Bad ideas
Soft spoken music to my ears (Yeah)
Spending my money
I wish I had spent time
(I'm not quite sure what went wrong)
But no, our legacy sheets can bring me sweet dreams
How strange is it when ours is lost in them (Baby)
I said whenever you called, I’d be there (Baby)
I hope you never take advice from your friends (Nеver, never)
Crammеd into the back seat of my first car that I drove too fast, running from the thought I
Know you don't get it when I say I been ballin'
It’s all bless
You couldn't stop crying, I couldn't cry at all (O-oh)
How can I dance myself clean?
These rooms just dirty my soles (Easy)
Slowly my friends turned to places
I can't be everywhere at once
I watched some friends turn to places
Now it's just a one-way convo (Yeah)
And til' you're not afraid of goin'
I’ll be right here on your arm
And when it’s not my choice in stayin'
I’ll go
I know our legacy sheets can't bring me sweet dreams
How strange is it when ours is lost in them
I said whenever you called, I'd be there
I hope you never take advice from your friends (Never, never)
Crammed into the back seat of my first car that I drove too fast running from the thought I
Know you don't get it when I tell you I’m ballin'
Ballin'
We were just kids
You couldn't stop crying, I couldn't cry at all (O-oh)
How can I dance myself clean?
These rooms just dirty my soles
Slowly my friends turned to places (I watched friends turn to places)
And I can't be everywhere at once (And I can't go and visit them all)
I watched my friends turn to places
And now it's just a one-way convo (Baby)
Ooh, ooh
Rest easy

Oooh, oh, oh
We look like a slasher film
Playing out of sequence
Baby, it's just feedback
Looking on my demons
Told them if I'm gonna die it's with you
You were like the breeze when this went under three
Feel like if we don't sleep then it all is just a dream
they don't find us, tonight
If time could stand still
If I could change
Maybe I'd have found the words
To tell me, to tell you, to say
I couldn't stay here forever
We look like a slasher film
Cut up out of sequence
Running from my crime scenе
Baby, I'm still bleeding
And I can never go back
I just want you to know that
I've been staring at thе ceiling
Looking for a breach
Even in the silence
I can say that it's just seconds away
If time could stand still
If I could change
Maybe I'd have found the words
(To tell you) To tell you that
I feel like I could puke my guts up
If they weren't already on the floor
I feel like I'm losing grip on love
And you can grab my hand as we run off
Maybe we'll make it after dawn
But in the sunlight we'll be different
If time could stand still
If I could change
Maybe I'd have found the words
To tell you, to tell you, to say
I couldn't stay here forever

(The sun can not see our home
'Til death or peace, I see you)
How do I say
All I want just falls away?
I don’t know how to keep us in time, time
Mind is changing
All you want so far is love, death and some kind of higher high
You're reaching (Reaching)
And if we're all just drifting by
(You’ve got to pull yourself out)
Phones in the air
Face to the sky
(You're gonna burn yourself out)
And all this time to realize there's nothing stopping you
(How are you gonna stop it?
You can't stop yourself from being you)
From leaving
(Wanted to, wanted)
And please don't go, drifter
(Staying when you're passing on, passing over me)
And please don't go, drifter
(In taking, take it, you're taken with all this)
What do I say?
All that time just thrown away
I don’t know how to keep lives apart
They’re bleeding (Yeah)
Mind is racing
All you want so far is love, death and some kind of higher high
You're reaching (Reaching)
And if we’re all just drifting by
Phones in the air
Face to the sky
All this time to realize there's nothing stopping you
From leaving me
(The sun can not see our home
'Til death or peace, I see you
How you want me)
And please don't go, drifter
(We all see, we are just orbiting you)
And please don’t go, drifter
(Stardust in your constellation)
(Planets in your solar system)
And please don't go, drifter
(Spiral, sink in, slighting with her, violent system)
And please don't go, drifter
(I'll listen, find us waning, Ire at the odds)
(You can't hear me at all)
And please don't go, drifter
(Time is wasting, breath is wasted on you)
And please don't go, drifter
(And please don't go)

You used to, you used to
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out
Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wеaring less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagnе out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone, oh
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city, you
You and me, we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places you just don't belong
And ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages on your passport
Hanging with some girls I've never seen before
These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
No, no, no
Why you never alone
Why you always touching road
Used to always stay at home, be a good girl
You was in the zone, yeah
You should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else
You don't need no one else
I know
Why you never alone
Why you always touching road
You and old friends don't speak no more
What you switching for
And you changed your tactics
Fuck your plastic
It don't change the past
And the same old sad shit
Now you could buy friends
You can't deny it
Cause we don't talk no more, oh
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city-

'Cause we've been driving so long
I can't remember how we got here
Or how we survived so long
Trying to run from our pride
'Till you set fire to my atmosphere
And I remember how I spent the twenty-third
Feeling six feet under
When I'm thirty-thousand feet in the air
Chasing that sundown
So far east I'm westbound
Feeling like the edge of this world is near
But you'll feel better when you wake up
Swear to god I'll make up
Everything and more when I get back someday
This is more than just a phase, love
Shooting stars all break up
And even though it seems like half the world away
Things will be better in America
Heard the streets are gold there
Maybe I could fly you out this place someday
Chasing dreams like I'm on Novocaine
Screaming through your airwaves
Looking back I almost thought I heard you say
Stay, you're not gonna leave me
This place is right where you need to be
And why your words gotta mean so much to them
And they mean nothing to me?
So stay, you're not what you're hearing
'Cause I've been watching you changing
And who said you're one in a million, anyway?
'Cause you see only what you want to
Your tunnel vision owns you
And you can't see what's wrong
When you keep sleeping through the PM
Eyes wide open when you're dreaming
You’re sleepwalking, just keep talking
Maybe you can talk your way out of this deep end
No B-plan in your system
Just tell me what you're thinking
I'm scared that you might fall
But you're not
But you're not
And you'll feel better when you wake up
Taking off your makeup
Sun always seems to wash our fears away
And it's always shining somewhere
I just gotta get there
And even though it seems like half the world away
Things are better in America
Heard the streets are gold there
Maybe I could fly you out this place someday
Chasing dreams like I'm on Novocaine
Screaming through your airwaves
Looking back I almost thought I heard you say
Stay, you're not gonna leave me
This place is right where you need to be
And why your words gotta mean so much to them
And they mean nothing to me?
So stay, you're not what you're hearing
'Cause I've been watching you changing
And who said you're one in a million?
You’re so much better than that
You’re so much better than that
You’re so much better than that
Stay, you're not what you're hearing
'Cause I've been watching you changing
And who said you're one in a million anyway?
And you'll feel better when you wake up
Swear to God, I'll make up
Everything and more when I get back someday
Chasing dreams like I'm on Novocaine
Screaming through your airwaves
Looking back I almost thought I heard you say:
"You're so much better than that"

She says I'm no good with my hands
But I'd hold up the whole sky for her
I want to forget my future and jump into the dark
I would've caused so much trouble
If I'd had you to sneak out with me
All our future's melted in your hands
They're drowning us
Still I say things like, "No hindsight in 2020"
"Got my sight checked, that's precious to me"
"Can't blindside me, I'm well aware"
"If you were me, I'd burn this out"
"To the sound of the daylight slipping from me"
"All our yesterdays spent misguided, sliding'"
And now our heels worn down and self aware
With dreams of stopping
You must have me messed up with somebody else
You got me mixed up, you got me stressed out
Youth spent plaited under walls, waterfalls
Walls can talk to things like
(Dreams of stopping, dreams of stopping)
(Dreams of)
You must have me messed up with somebody else
You got me mixed up, you got me stressed out
Youth spent plaited under walls, waterfalls
Walls can talk to things like
Still I say things like, "No hindsight in 2020"
"Got my sight checked, that's precious to me"
"Can't blindside me, I'm well aware"
"If you were me, I'd burn this out"
"To the sound of the daylight slipping from me"
"All our yesterdays spent misguided, sliding"
And now our heels worn down and self aware
With dreams of stopping, with dreams of stoppi–
Dreams worth stopping for
You know, our progress is just really slow
Because we're trying to just find ways through

Lord knows we're wrong
Ceilings were floors
That we clipped our lives through
But I'm closer to hope
Now down's become up
I can see the light skew
Hope I can see
But it's alright, I won't be long
Drilla come through and try snatch my phone
Inside-out, comme des garçons
No bad blood, I don't hold a grudge
Girls still try but I let it go
Proud of my tears, proud to be alone
Proud of my highs, proud of my lows
And though some of these things
Just out of our control, I've—
I know you think about me sometimes
I hope he treats you like you always wanted
In times these rushes wе feel won’t fly by
How can I think ahead? You're always on my mind
How can I think ahead? You'rе always—
Hate feeling like this
Thinking in crises
Feeling so cliché
Ooh
Tried to run from it
She said I'm not above it
I'm from it
Ooh
'Cause you were looking at me back like that
Rushing through the year trying to turn the clock back
I can’t always be there
But you know I'll come back
I been racing
And been in last for so long
But it's alright, I won't be long
Drilla come through and try snatch my phone
Inside-out, comme des garçons
No bad blood, don't hold a grudge
Girls still try but I let it go
Proud of my tears, proud to be alone
Proud of my highs, proud of my lows
And though some of these things
Just out of our control, I've—
(Peace)
I know you think about me sometimes
(That we clipped our lives through)
(A high you seek)
I hope he treats you like you always wanted
(Closer)
In time these rushes we feel won't fly by
(Seeing the lights)
How can I think ahead? You're always on my mind
(Seeing the lights)
How can I think ahead? You're always on my mind
(I can see the light-)
Every sight
I'm no—

Raining with chords now
You're crying your heart out
Trying to make less calls now
Lately I’ve come through
Telling you to slow down
I wanna
I gotta head out of here
Bet you think I'm overplaying my trust issues
Bet you think I'm lying so I can fuck with you
I ain’t got a reason to be home with you
Home with you (home with you)
I ain't coming home with you (home with you)
Baby, slow down
Raining, it's pouring now
Can't speak my language
Everything seems fine right now
If I'm down I'm all in
Show you out if I show up
I can't go all in
But you think I'm overplaying my trust issues
Think I’m lying just so I can fuck with you
Believe me I ain’t doing it, baby, I need you
Every time I can't be here I just want fade me
You need friends like us
It’s not trust
It's locked up
Been waiting for you, oh you
It's not love
Don't feel the trust
Been waiting on you, yeah
Yeah yeah
Life with no limits
No, I can’t gauge the distance
No
Doing tabs drawn and manage it
Anxiety and the internet
Can't speak because I'm indifferent
Built time of our friendship
Will type until it finishes, you know
Oh down, baby slow it down
Give that showdown, baby slow it down
Can't control it now, baby throw it down
You remind me of my shows when you sold out
Get my money,
Get my money,
She need me when I need her and I can't go now
You need friends like us
It's locked up
It's not trust
Been waiting on you, oh you
It's not love
Don't feel the trust
Been waiting on you, yeah
Yeah yeah

Let's go
I think she's pretty without any makeup on
She thinks I'm funny when I tell the punch line wrong
I know she gets me, so I let my walls come down, yeah
Before you met me, I was alright
But things were kinda heavy, you brought me to life
Now every February, you'll be my Valentine (-tine)
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forеver
You make me feel likе I'm livin' a
Teenage dream, the way you turn me on
I can't sleep, let's run away
And don't ever look back, don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch, now, baby, I believe
This is real, so take a chance
And don't ever look back, don't ever look back
We drove to Cali and got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you, my missing puzzle piece
I'm complete
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever
So am I wrong
For thinking we could be something for real?
Am I wrong
For trying to reach the things that I can't see? (Yeah)
But that's just how I feel
That's just how I feel, yeah
That's just how I feel
I try to reach the things that I can't see
And I'ma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
I let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
You make me feel like I'm livin' a (So am I wrong)
(For thinking we could be something for real?)
Teenage dream, the way you turn me on
I can't sleep, let's run away (So am I wrong?)
(For trying to reach the things that I can't see?)
And don't ever look back, don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me (But that's just how I feel)
(That's just how I feel)
Just one touch, now, baby, I believe
This is real, so take a chance (That's just how I feel)
(I try to reach the things that I can't see)
And don't ever look back, don't ever look back
That's just how I feel
Yeah, that's just how I feel
Ooh, that's just how I feel
At least I can see f-
That's just how I feel

Livin' like it's never too late
I know it don't matter
How do I feel in your hands? tell me
Holding on to words you say
Trying not to watch them decay
It's only going faster
Out of my hands, but in my head I'm screaming
I could quit if I wanted
But I know I'm never good at goodbyes
Some life, thinking that I could get it right
And I could quit if I wanted
But last time, you said you'd always be around
So, where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you?
Where are you now?
And I can see you try to quit, but it's a mess
So I'm TikTok dancing in your head
I was something you said that you couldn't live without
And now I just make you sick
I was sick and I was tired
I was down, and now I'm out
Pushing in and giving up
I can't get it out my mind
I look for you all the time
I look for you all the time
It's out of my hands, I'm screaming
I could quit if I wanted
But I know I'm never good at goodbyes
Some life, thinking that I could get it right
But I could quit if I wanted
And last time, you said you'd always be around
So, where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you?
Where are you now?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where?
And I can see you try to quit, but it's a mess
So I'm TikTok dancing in your head
I was something you said that you couldn't live without
And now i just make you sick

Breaking in with your new friend
Think of me when you shut it down, down, down, down
Heart breaking we–
And she said, “What you doing, can you come through?”
Certain things I wish I could undo
Don't want to feel a way so let it pass through
Waist pressed on you in a past life
She said undress her in the bathroom
Give me head, I love a good attitude
Falling for you in a vacuum
Slipping past 100 on the dash soon
When I call it, can you zoom?
Zoom, zoom, zoom yeah
Comms check, one, two
I thought about you all of my night
Found you outside
We had fun crimes
Collapsed some time
I'll cross your mind
Call me next time
Dilated eyes
Quick death, brief life
Crashing, crushing
I lost all focus
Blurring through these motions
You don't give a fuck since
Distance turned to oceans (I can't find my phone)
Weaponize the timeline
I've been here in real life (My whole life)
Dodging all these airstrikes
Anxious but it's alright
Martyrdom weather (Yeah)
(Weather)
Breaking in with your new friend
Think of me when you shut it down, down, down, down
I read your message through the lines
I just want to cool it off
She just loves crossing all these wires
Hands getting tied up in them
But don't you hate those clichés now?
Almost killed to not get stronger
The photos lasted longer
And after all this time we're not much taller
I know
I lost all focus
Blurring through these motions
You don't give a fuck since
Distance turned to oceans (I can't find my phone)
Weaponize the timeline
I've been here in real life (My whole life)
Dodging all these airstrikes
Anxious but it's alright
Martyrdom weather
Breaking in with your new friend
(Weather)
Think of me when you shut it down
Fucking me out of your head
Heart breaking we're solo, ah
Breaking in with your new friend
Think of me when you shut it dow-

So tell me this is who you are, yeah
They tell me I've got something more
And oh, you could be loved
But I don't want the lights to find me
When I'm dark and lost, but never on my own
'Cause I just wanna swing like Sinatra
Singing like I can't stop
'Cause I could never rock like a Rolling Stone
I just wanna live like the ones before, yeah
And maybe I could play guitar like Hendrix or save the world or end it, and
Then maybe they'll remember me when I'm gone
That's all I could ever want
That's all I want
So I got ten minutes to be all or nothing to whoever wants to hear
And I got ten weeks of talking bullshit on repeat 'til I'm burnt out and disappear
But I owe you nothing
And I own my luck
Oh, they said, "You'll never be alone again"
But I don't think you understand me or what I fear
"But you could be loved"
But I don't wanna lie to tell myself
I'm more than all the mistakes I've outrun
'Cause I'm only here for a minute
And I don't care what you say 'cause I know
You're only here 'cause I'm winning
But I can be my own kind of rock and roll
I, I don't really care if you say you don't fuck with me
And I can say what the fuck I want 'cause it's down to me, and
I got love for you even if you are doubting me
Like, oh, my god, I just can't stop
'Cause I just wanna sing like Sinatra with ethanol my soundtrack
'Cause I could never rock like a Rolling Stone
I wonder how it feels to burn out young, yeah
'Cause I just wanna die before my heart fails from heartbreak or cocktails, and
Then maybe you'll cry once you know I'm gone
That's all I could ever want, oh, that's all I want, yeah
'Cause I ain't scared of livin'
Does it get easier?
No
No, I ain't scared of livin'
Yes, it gets easier
Oh yeah?
No, I ain't scared of livin'
Look at you
(Sex, drugs, and rock and roll, that's all I want)
'Cause it's all we've got, what are we breathin' for if we ain't living?
I ain't scared of livin'
(What's under the words you know, that's all I want)
And I don't want your love, I just wanna feel like I'm still livin'
I ain't scared of livin'
(Something more than superficial is all I want)
And if there is no god, I know the day I die, I lived through heaven
(Sex, drugs, and rock and roll, that's all I want)
And that I gave it hell
And if it hurt, oh well, at least, that's living
I ain't scared of livin'
The more you know who you are and what you want
That's all I want
The less you let things upset you
That's all I want
I just don't know what I'm supposed to be, you know?
I tried being a writer, but
I hate what I write
And I tried taking pictures, but they were so mediocre
You know, and every girl goes through a photography phase
You know, like horses
You know, take, uh, dumb pictures of your feet
You'll figure that out, I'm not worried about you
If all we had is time, then we'll be alright
It's not much, but it's better than nothing
Sex, drugs and rock and roll, that's all I want
What's under the words, you know that's all I want
Something more than superficial is all I want
Sex, drugs and rock and roll, that's all I want

Forest trees and final season growth
Oh, I can't find you
And I don't know if I want to
I can't find you
And I don't know
Words don't fall as easy
As lies don’t find
It's seeming that words don't follow
As easy as I wanted them to
If at the center of all is nothing
Then I'm sure we'll meet again
Just as the sun, it sets in circles
In elliptical phases in darkness, I know
I don't

What went wrong?
Running on empty
I waited years in a past life
Running out of rope and the water's high
I drowned for you and I didn't regret it
Don't text me back in the afterlife
Needed the time, I didn't realise
I had it all along, can't take my own advice
Conflated filling the gaps for love
And it's obvious that I'm caved in and breaking up
But I know it's good (I know it's good)
I know it's good (I know it's good)
Though it's over now, in my dreams you call me back
But I hope you don't (I hope you don't)
I hope you don't (I hope you don't)
I hope you're gone and lost in better days
I've been watching the time, how it erodes away
Thinking 'bout how the last years feel like yesterdays
How did I lose grip on it?
Honest, been falling through nightmares, light years away
And doing my best to keep those thoughts at bay
And finding my highlights in the loudest places
And strangers' faces getting caught up in the race of it
(How did we get lost overgrown?)
And walking through the clearing crowd
If we took our chances (When it's time to go)
And we exchanged glances, call it in the moment
(When did I lose all this love?)
And walking down the road that I grew up on
And falling out of habits
Stop bleeding for empathy's sake
And it's obvious that I'm caved in and breaking up
But I know it's good, I know it's good, ooh
Though it's over now, in my dreams you call me back
But I hope you don't, I hope you don't
'Cause I don't need you to tell me that
(Walking through the clear—)
(Breaking up) (We took our chances)
I don't need you to tell me that
(How did we get overgrown?)
(But we exchanged glances) (It's good)
(Call it in the moment)
I don't need you to tell me that
(Now it's time to go soon)
(Walking down the road that I grew up on)
(You'd call me back, but I hope you don't)
Oh I don't need you to tell me that
It's okay, I'm going (It's okay, I'm going)
I'm searching (I'm searching)
For what I am now (For what I am now)
I'll find you if it's urgent (Find you if it's urgent)
Or if I'm hurting (If I'm hurting)
More than I am now (Than I am now)
And we'll come back here someday
(Back here someday)
And laugh about it (Laugh about it)
Memories that don't know
How it felt like I was burning (Like I was burning)
While you weren't watching
Took everything I loved
Now nowhere feels like home, (feels like home), home
Now nowhere feels like home, home
Yeah, nowhere feels like home, (home), home
Yeah, ooh, yeah, nowhere feels like home
Been a long life, still got mad time (Feels like home)
Took a wrong right on it last time (Don't)
Through the long night, made it out alright
Told my brother, "Hold tight"
Sometimes I can feel it, I can feel it
Sometimes I still (Sometimes I still)
(Nowhere feels like home)
Sometimes I feel (Sometimes I feel)
(Nowhere feels like home)
Some times (Some times)
(Nowhere feels like home, nowhere feels like home)
(Nowhere feels like home, nowhere feels like home)
(Obvious) Nowhere feels like home, nowhere feels like home
Nowhere feels like home, nowhere feels like home
Nowhere feels like home, nowhere feels like home
Nowhere feels like home, nowhere feels like-

Runnin' on empty
I waited years in a past life
Runnin' out of rope and the waters high
I drowned for you and I didn't regret it
Text me back in the afterlife
Needed the time didn't realise
I had it all along, can't take my own advice
Conflated, fillin' the gaps for love
And it's obvious
That I'm caved in and breaking up
But I know it's gone
I know it's gone
But what's over now
In my dreams you call me back
But I hope you don't
I hope you don't
I hope you're gone off to better days
I been watching the time, how it erodеs away
Thinkin' 'bout how the last years feel like yеsterday
How did I lose grip on it
Honest
Been fallin' through nightmares, light years away
And doin' my best to keep those thoughts at bay
Finding my highlights are the loudest places
And strangers faces
Getting caught up in a race of it
And walking through the clearing ground
If we took our chances
And we exchanged glances, yeah
Call it in a moment
And walking down the road that I grew up on
And fallin' out of habits
Stop pleading for empathy
And it's obvious
That I'm caved in and breaking up
But I know it's gone
I know it's gone
But what's over now
In my dreams you call me back
But I hope you don't
I hope you don't
'Cause I don't need you to tell me
I don't need you to tell me
'Cause I
I don't need you to tell me
No I don't need you to tell me
It's okay I'm going
I'm searching
For what I am now
I'll find you if it's urgent
Or if I'm hurtin'
More than I am now
And we'll come back here some day
And laugh about it
Memories that don't recall
How it felt like I was burnin'
While you weren't watchin'
Took everything I loved
No nowhere feels like home
Home
No nowhere feels like home
Home
No nowhere feels like home  Oooo
Home

I can't focus on anything
Sunset blinded me and my friends
Turn the mines into Stonehenge
New graves, little start gone
UK single spin experiment
Wanna be a person
Rerouted to be back to Bethlehem
Genesis' a lost time
Didn't wake up but it's morning now
Big pressure, I'm a cannonball
Skydive to the swimming pool
Splashing on an impulse
Radiating with some edibles
Call me if I'm sinking
Crushing on you with my atom bomb
I don't have to wake up
I don't have to be him
You don't have to love me
I don't need a godsend
Just love it when it's bright out
Sunrise is calling
Just feel it when it's loudest
I can't believe it
Yeah
(Love what's left)
(Love what's left)
(Love what's left) Yeah
(Done your best)
(Done your-)
(Take my breath)
(Take my breath)
(Take my-)
I'll get it right in the next life
I get it, I get it here
Seeing the stars
Hit me like a frame line
Though I saw it coming my whole life
Chasing like county prestige now
Arching over immigrants and meltdowns
Flaming up my calls from your mansions
I don't give a fuck about your bag now
Did this really happen
How am I here
Prediction of predicated of my fears
How do I explain that I'm really fucking sad
When it's not your fault
I have everything
(Love what's left)
(Love what's left)
(Love what's left)
(Done your best) Is this working out?
(Done your best)
(Done your-)
(Take my breath) Working out
(Take my breath)
(Take my-)
I'll get it right in the next life
I get it, I get it here
Laying outside
Time may heal me
Heartbreak sunshine
It's a long ride down I've to help you
I don't have to wake up (I don't have to wake up)
I don't have to be him
You don't have to love me (You don't have to love me)
I don't need a godsend
Just love when it's bright out
Sunrise is calling
I feel at peace
I could be me

Speaking of another life
Rooftop convos, backstory of tattoos
I can't imagine
Eye contact fast, high hopes got dashed
When you called me up
I can't believe my luck
The ghost I love's in love
With someone else and he doesn't know about us
And now it's fading away
(And now it's fading away)
I feel something
(And now it's fading away, feel something)
It's fading away (self-destructive)
It's fading away
But can't I make you see, you belong with me
Don't you know you're throwing it away, throwing it away
Throwing it a-
Can't I make you see, you belong with me
Don't you know you're throwing it away, throwing it away
Throwing it a-
Sometimes when I feel what it does to mе
I just wanna throw it all away, throwing it away
Throwing it, throwing it away, throwing it away
Throwing it, throwing it away, throwing it away
Throwing it
Gun hands in the air, slow motion
Got me feeling something strangе, it's a cold ocean
Ahadadream showing me new ways
I had a dream, there was no escape
You got me back in your own ways
I ate that karma, now the debts paid
Eye for an eye, we saw each other change
Orbits we had decoupled, in decay
Then a couple years show me new sides of familiar faces
We fell out of touch, out of sync it chafed
Fell on my face hit you for commiserations
The tee shirt said the heart had changed
Those texts made me a ghost in the shell
How can I make you see, you belong with me
Don't you know you're throwing it away, throwing it away
Throwing it a-
Can't I make you see, you belong with me
Don't you know you're throwing it away, throwing it away
Throwing it a-
Sometimes when I feel what it does to me (I feel something)
I just wanna throw it all away, throwing it away (something)
Throwing it, throwing it away, throwing it away (self-destructive)
Throwing it, throwing it away, throwing it away
Throwing it
I feel something (feel something)
It's fading away (self-destructive)
It's fading awa-

How’d you like to see the world?
How to hold you when it hurts
Your eyes, they drift in hazy light
Yeah, the cruelty of circumstance and time
I don't want to wake you up
It's clear you'd rather be elsewhere
I'd rather be in love

Ek onthou die begin van November maand op ñ wingerd in die kaap
Jy't gestaan teen die bas van 'n koelte boom ek was te bang om met jou te praat
Soos die son wegsak en dit skemer word en jy saggies aan my raak en
Die maan raak vol en my hart loop oor van die butterflies in die kaap
Net soos die wind waai en als verander jy laat my kop nog draai want jy
Gee my nog steeds butterflies
Kom le hier langs my dat ek meer van jou kry net soos die eerste keer gee
Jy my nog steeds butterfliеs
Dis al vyftien jaar in November maand lyk nog diеselfde in die kaap teen daai
Koelteboom waar ons name staan vra jy my weer vir 'n dans
En dit voel nou weer soos daai eerste keer toe jy fluister in my oor
Dit begin van voor en my hart loop oor van die butterflies in die kaap
Net soos die wind waai en als verander jy laat my kop nog draai want jy
Gee my nog steeds butterflies
Kom le hier langs my dat ek meer van jou kry net soos die eerste keer gee
Jy my nog steeds butterflies
*Ohohohoho*
Net soos die wind waai...
*Ohohohoho*
Laat jy my kop nog draai
*Ohohohoho*
Wie sou dit ooit kon raai
*Ohohohoho*
Jy gee my nog mmmhmmh
Net soos die wind waai en als verander
Jy laat my kop nog draai want jy gee my nogsteeds butterflies
Kom le hier langs my dat ek meer van jou kan kry net soos die eerste keer gee jy my nogsteeds butterflies
Net soos die wind waai
Jy laat my kop nog draai
Want jy gee my nogsteeds butterflies
Kom le hier langs my dat ek meer van jou kry net soos die eerste keer gee jy my nogsteeds butterflies
*Ohohohoho*
Gee jy my nog butterflies
*Ohohohoho*
Want jy gee my nogsteeds butterflies

朝、目が覚めるとなぜか泣いている
You know, our progress is just really slow
Because we're trying to just find ways through
And we're just veering
Backwards at times just to get through some of this stuff
And it's just crazy, all the things that we have to do
Bleeding out was such a sweet lie
Forget about it sometimes
Till' went forward and it don't stop
Too much time in your own thoughts
The feelings only conspired
What you didn't do is barbed wire
How many times is the last one, one?
But we're out of time
Ghost town
No hurt can catch us now
So stumble on your own ways
Lost a second in the hallway
We were nothing and we're better off
Falling right back out of place
Heartbreak subsides till' we're home
Cycle through panic and grace
Compulsion taking control
(No harm in feeling afraid)
Gonna run till it stops
You're gonna fight back the tears
I hold my breath from the start
And felt it coming for years
So keep on breaking my heart (of course the past can be changed)
Until it kills me I swear (I watched it bend while I talk)
With every second I've lost and exhausted the love I bought and sold
Just drifting in and out of love
You're fading
We're out of time
Ghost town
No hurt can catch us now
We're out of time
Ghost town
No hurt can catch us now

I used to wonder how it'd feel like
I looked to everyone for answers
Chasing round and down in circles, on purpose
In search of something
I spent a while trying to learn somehow
Some missing pieces will not stop me
I tried to fill my gaps with heartbeats, so fleeting, but cold feet
I’m sorry
And I still don't know how I feel about it
And I still don't know but I feel like I'm learning
How to clear my head when all I think about is you
But I'm only human
I found out, I know now
I still wonder how I'd have turned out
If I'd done everything I wanted
If I'd lived like I feel like I could've, or should've
When I was younger
But I'm good now, I found out
That I still don't know how I feel about it
And I still don't know but I feel like I'm learning
How to catch my breath when all I'm breathing for is you
I can't keep holding it down
But you keep showing me how
If you're only human
Oh, I think I found out, woah
I think I know now
I used to wonder what love is
But ever since you've been around
I finally think I have it figured out
What I missed then, but see now
I found out, I know now

I feel on the ouside, baby
Wanna pick up where we left off
They just want a lifestyle, baby
No matter what it cost
But in my dreams
I'm in love still, baby
Took damage, she ain't call
He said, "Fuck that bitch, she ain't want to dance"
Paris, France got me low
If I could colourgrade all of my evenings
Blood in the sky, call it healing
Ersatz, we was cool for the moment
Whiplash, we was driving on the phone
And we can't always make right, and I feel it
Long road back for a villain
If I walk that arc, 'til I feel right
But I feel right
All you could've done, how'd you let this happen?
Falling out of love, called me enigmatic
I won't calm down if you gon' drink too
You with me, and when you don't want me too
I'll text you in Paris, no
(I don't know how I can explain to you, I don't care)
Like there was something in the air
That had you crying your eyes out (crying)
Sometimes I can't tell if it's real
Sometimes it's all I think about, 'bout
But still, I'd rather do it, then have never done it
Teargas in Paris, I recovered from it
I'll become your village, how you feel about it?
Those are the days I gotta love
Like there was something in the air
That had you crying your eyes out (crying)
I can't tell if it's real
Sometimes it's all I think about, 'bout
Like there was something in the air
That had you crying your eyes out (crying)
Sometimes I can't tell if it's real
Sometimes it's all I think about, 'bout
Like there was something in the air
Sometimes I can't tell if it's real

Uh, uh, vai morrer
Uh, uh, vai morrer
What are you gonna sing for us?
I'm gonna sing Friday Night, which is my original song
What's it about?
It's about a Friday night
Oh ri–
This shit all I want
Died a million times for it
Working all week long
Trying to make some time for you
I need a lift sometimes
Don't have the right chemicals
Can you play my favourite song?
It hits me when I'm down, I kinda love it though
And the drums keep moving on
We got so close, I held your hands above your head
You don't understand
I get so bored with that self-obsession
Obsession, oh, but babe, it's not a problem
Don't say a word, just listen to the violent music play
It's Friday, I'm in love again
Or just drunk I guess, I feel so amazing
In the A.M. I'll daydream of this
I can't lose
I spend Friday nights with my hands in the air
No, it's not that deep, just surrendеring
'Cause when Friday ends, it all starts again
I can't losе
I can't stop thinking 'bout my death, yeah
I decided I want to dance, babe
We were lying on the grass (uh)
If not me, that's someone else, okay?
I need a lift sometimes
After the wave, it gets low
And you play my favourite songs
You've hit me when I'm down, I kinda love it though
And the drum–
And what brought you here?
Well, I had, uh, goals and dreams
And I was sort of chasing them-
Sort of chasing them-
And the drum beat cycles on
We got so close, I held your hands above your head
You don't understand
I get so bored with that self-obsession
Obsessed with all the ways that we are
The strobe lights like armour
I don't feel the same
And that's all that I wanted
And they'll say it's hollow
And they want to call it an issue
But we're not listening, just play it again
'Cause it's Friday, I'm in love again
Or just drunk I guess, I feel so amazing
In the A.M. I'll daydream of this (Woo!)
I can't lose
I spend Friday nights with my hands in the air
No, it's not that deep, just surrendering
'Cause when Friday ends, what the fuck is left?
I can't lose, yeah
Again, oh, yeah

I just wanted to feel closer to you
On and off again
I don't really need your help
I break my heart by myself
Defeatist when I talk
But baby, you're talking the same way
Out of here, closed for now
I can't be the o-o-o-o-o-one
I can't be the o-o-o-o-o-one
I can't be the o-o-o-o-o-one
I can't be the o-o-o-o-o-one
Couldn't be
Couldn't feel before I gave it to you
Couldn't be
Couldn't you feel my heart before I get to you
I can feel myself you know
And I just wanted to feel closer to you
On and off again
I don't really need your help
I brеak my heart by myself
Defеatist when I talk
But baby, you're talking the same way
Out of here, closed for now
I can't be the o-o-o-o-o-one
I can't be the o-o-o-o-o-one
I can't be the o-o-o-o-o-one
I can't be the o-o-o-o-o-one

(If you fall, I'll catch you)
So I've been thinking 'bout something
Lately, I've been alive (I'm alive)
'Cause I found my reason in nothing
So I won't close my eyes
'Cause I don't want to miss one second
And I don't want to feel so cold
And I don't want to be so sad that we are who we are
'Cause we had no control
But only by the night
Will we ever make headlines?
Will we ever make things right?
When we've only ourselves to blame
When we've only ourselves to blame
So I won't sleep, no more
No, I won't sleep, no more
I won't sleep
I always thought that there'd be more than just wishing my life away (No)
Like I could always, figure it out
And never have to abandon what's in front of me (DMT won't stop me)
Dream no more
So get this doubt out of my head
It's only real if you let it
And I've been letting go of my ghosts
I'll never let them catch me no more
These words are all I have, so I'll just keep dreaming out loud (Out loud)
And if I just keep talking, maybe I'll figure all this out (This out)
But only by the night
Will we ever make headlines?
Will we ever make things right?
When we've only ourselves to blame
And we've only ourselves to blame
So I won't sleep, no more
No, I won't sleep, no more
No, I won't sleep
I always thought that there'd be more than just wishing my life away (No more)
Like I could always, figure it out
And never have to abandon what's in front of me (DMT won't stop me)
Dream no more

Come on, what’s the big deal? Nobody’s that heartless
So listen here, I'm the voice in your head
And I can say the words that make you feel scared
So here's to you, and all the problems that we've made
And I know it's so hard to stay afloat
When you make monsters out of thoughts
And you're dragged under
And everyone in around you is too far away to notice
Your chest start to crush, oh, but it's alright
Oh, you'll be alright
So just breathe, it's almost over
And don’t let the monster in your head
Become your fears
'Cause you can save yourself, you know
You know
So listen here, I know it's hard
Maybe I can't be what you want
But I'm just who I am, and I'm trying to be what you could need
And I am still here, that voice in your head
And I'll be there for you, when no one else cares
And this is it, as far as where we've got since then
So know a good thing when you got it
And I hope you know you don't go alone
Come on, what’s the big deal? Nobody’s that heartless
You know it's time
It's time to decay

And I said what's up? What you been thinking?
'Cause you've been staring at that roof so long, I swear it's come alive
And she spoke nine words and now we're sinking
But I can't find it in myself to want to lie to keep this thing from going down
'Cause that girl took my heart
And I ain't want it back
No
I'm laying down my cards
'Cause you said it meant nothing
And I should've kept my silence
But I guess I'm too attached to my own pride to let you know
That all these words meant nothing
And I've always been this heartless
But we're just having sex, no, I would never call it love
But love
Oh, no, I think I'm catching feelings
And I don't know if this is empathy I feel
Just hold on
Remember why you said this was the last time?
Woah, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
Woah, and, so I guess it's
Woah, hey, yeah, yeah
Woah, let die to let live
And what's good
When both choices I've got
Have us staring down the barrel to the bullets I can't stop?
And so I stand off like indecision's Kevlar
'Til this fear of feeling stops and I'm done
But you
No, I don't know how to forget you
No, I don't know how to forget you
No, I don't know how to forget you
No, I don't know how to forget you
(No, I don't know how to forget you)
'Cause that girl took my heart
(No, I don't know how to forget you)
And I ain't want it back, no
(No, I don't know how to forget you)
A bulletproof restart
Oh, no, I think I'm catching feelings
And I don't know if this is empathy I feel
Just hold on
Remember why you said this was the last time?
Woah, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
Woah, and, so I guess it's
Woah, hey, yeah, yeah
Woah, let die to let live
No, I don't know how to forget you
No, I don't know how to forget you
No, I don't know how to forget you
No, I don't know how to forget you

Your eyes
They drift through hazy lines
The cruelty
Of circumstance and time
I don't want to wake you up
It's clear you'd rather be elsewhere
I'd rather be in love

Boy, you're in a hurry
If you were lookin' at what I'm looking at, you'd be in a hurry too
Y'know how everyone's saying, "seize the moment?"
(Can't you feel it?)
I don't know, I'm kinda thinking it's the other way around, you know?
Like, the moment seizes us

My baby don't mess around
Because she loves me so and this I know for sure
But does she really want it
But can't stand to see me walk out the door?
Don't try to fight the feeling
'Cause the thought alone is killing me right now
And thank God for Mom and Dad
For sticking two together 'cause we don't know how
Hey ya, hey ya
Hey ya, hey ya
You think you got it, oh, you think you got it
But "got it" just don't get it when there's nothing at all
We get together, oh, we get together
But separate's always better when's there's feelings involved
If what they say is "nothing is forever"
Then what makes, then what makes
Then what makes love the exception?
And why-o, why-o, why-o, why-o, why-o, why-o
Are we so in denial when we know we're not happy here? Yeah
But hey ya, hey ya
Hey ya, hey ya
Hey ya, hey ya
Hey ya, hey ya
I'm too cool, I'm too cool for this (Hey ya)
I'm too cool, I'm too cold for this (Hey ya)
I'm too cold, I'm too cool for this (Hey ya)
I'm too cool, I'm too cold for this
I'm too cool, I'm too cold for this (Hey ya)
I'm too cool
I'm too cold

And I know I've been closing myself off, unsure
I know I've been real hard to reach, harder to love
And I know it's tiring, this shit is getting old
But please, just hold on to me
I've slayed these demons, they're old to me
Recurring dreams, this is happening
Tearing my seams; lucid reality
And I just want you to feel love (love!)
Before it disappears (not!)
'Cause we are more than we're not (wrong!)
So never fear to feel (brave!)
Good when everything's wrong (love!)
And find some beauty there (not!)
'Cause all we ever are is brave (brave!)
And your world's not ending, ooh
So I won't go
I'm still living in the middle of a one-way war
I can't fight it but I'm trying to be what you want, yeah
You can't sing but you're singing this anyway
And anyway, so please just hold on to me
This is no end, we're not finished here
Finding our way, we're just changing
Becoming more than I think of me, yeah
These fears in my head, dreams in my bed
They won't get the best of me, yeah
'Cause I chase dreams 'till the end
These nightmares all bend
Silver linings are all I need
So, please, just hold on to me
I've slayed these demons, they're old to me
Recurring dreams, this is happening
Tearing my seams from reality
And I just want you to feel love
Before it disappears
'Cause we are more than we're not
So never fear to feel
Good when everything's wrong (love!)
And find some beauty there (not!)
'Cause all we ever are is brave

I bought into the life
That's glowing too bright
Gotta shade my eyes
Infinite night
You're spending my time like a platinum card
And I say keep it straight, it's bending
We both had the window closed
I'm out with my feet expended
How long? (Woo)
But I say to myself, "Keep going"
No time like the time I waste
She said I'm a lucky charm
Guess we all gotta make mistakes
And it's still bright
What you mean it's too late?
I got daylight
How long 'til the ceiling breaks? (ah)
But you can always change your mind
This is not the place and time
(I almost didn't think of you)
I believe you saw nothing
(Running in and out of luck)
I'm running in and out of touch (out of, out of)
Don't get close to anyone (anyone)
I don't feel close to anyone (anyone)
But you could always change your mind
In time, late
It's too late, we're on our way
It's too late, it's hard to say
It's too late to call the days, days
Yeah, yesterday
Listening, call me
Then answer the phone, "What you want?"
I'm missing you, you're on my mind
I can't believe it, but it's draining
Send so much bloop
And don't call me, it's the truth
You can call it karma too, if you want
Letting you stay in
If you want it, get your phone out my house
But you know
It's too late, it's all I say
It's too late to call it day
I feel everything the same (yeah)
I kill it, it's all in flames
Don't relate to all my friends
Can you believe it's more than nothing?
Yeah-yeah
Slow down, I'll call tomorrow
Still change your mind
You could still change your mind

This video is called twenty.
So... Where do i begin?
I guess since this is the first time I've done this, I'll start with the basics.
You all know me as EDEN, and by the time you're watching this I will  be twenty years old.
It's funny how you don't realize how much things have changed until you've stopped to look back. I never had a euphoric moment where I thought "This is it. Everything is about to change.", no.. that doesn't happen, but still somehow, here i am three-hundred and sixty-five days later, wondering if a turning point even exists.
And, that's not to say nothing eventful has happened this year, either.
I dropped out of school, I released some music, and somehow that allowed me to travel a bit, even though I've never even played a show.
I made some new friends, and team EDEN now has more than one member, with the addition of my manager and lawyer back in Autumn.
So, what does that mean?
Am I gonna start making different music?
Absolutely not.
Is my manager gonna start posting or tweeting for me?
Absolutely not.
I mean, I started this on my own so that I could do what I want, how I want, when I want, and that's never gonna change. I own my future.
And, speaking of which, although I think this has been the most significant year of my life so far, 2015 has only scratched the surface of what I want to do.
I have more plans than you can imagine.
So, 2016....
Where do I begin?

One, two, three
"Start!"
That's pretty sick though, alright
Alright, next one, next one
Okay, this-
Now is the word "end" alright?
So one, two, three
"End!"
Sick, alright, what else we got?
Okay, "love"
One, two, three
"Love!"
"Not," one, two, three
"Not!"
No, not that
Two more words to go guys, alright?
Next word is "wrong," so one, two, three
"Wrong!"
Hell yeah
And last one is "brave"
So, one, two, three
"Brave!"
Thank you so much guys
Who knows? Hopefully that worked and you'll end up on a song

I think I lost myself out
Somewhere in between
Finding out who I am
Confusing that with what I dream
And it feels like everyone's done waiting
So what am I supposed to do?
And I can feel these bridges breaking
And I’m drifting further from you, from you
But oh, let it go
'Cause I found God
And he said, "Plans change a lot"
And, so if I can help my luck
Then things won't go the way they're going
And I won't lose hope, and I won't lose courage
And won't fade to gold
Or worse, a shadow
'Cause if everyone is gone, I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be left alone

Do you think we'll figure it out?
I’ve been folding in my head
I can't help feeling I missed out
Trying to disappear
I got places I could go
I got money I could burn
I got people they don't know
I got no worries ’cause I'm up
Baby, I'm losing you
Can you come and find me?
I put my thoughts on mute
Can't find it, they don't even vibrate
I was anything you want me to
You were leaving here without me
Come and get me, I've been fighting
I've been thinking 'bout it too
Too much
Do you think we’re gonna make it?
Are we gonna even try?
Can you text me in the morning?
Send your love before I fly?
I thought that we were dancing out the darkness
Were we just fading in the light?
Maybe like plane’s lined up for LAX
Looks just like lanterns in the sky
Is this supposed to feel like a light ending fate?
I'll be your loneliness killer
For times you closed on me
And the fears I’ve had
I'll be your loneliness killer
I'll be alone with you
Just losing you
Can you come and find me?
I put my phone on mute
Can't find it, it don’t even vibrate
I was anything you want me to
You were leaving here without me
Come and get me I've been fighting
I've been thinking 'bout it too
Do you think we're gonna make it?
Are we gonna even try?
Can you text me in the morning?
Send your love before I fly?
I thought that we were dancing out the darkness
Was I just fading in the light?
Maybe like plane's lined up for LAX
Looks just like lanterns in the sky
I hope everything's alright
I been fighting not to fly
Call me back, it's all the pain
Killer
It's not the same
I can feel it, its the fate

I'm only mad 'cause I love you
And you keep fucking with my mood swings
Just want the things that don't want you
Now I'm so bored of this
And there's some themes I won't ever get to feel
Roof-down Testarossa, arms swaying in the breeze
There's some things I won't get to relive
Roof-top, arms around each other momentarily
We're alright
What in the world could've changed your mind?
What kind of world do you dream about?
I dreamt of death, and it eased my mind
Baby, don't stress, happens all the time
We misconnect, I don't pay no mind
What kind of love couldn't leavе my mind?
I think of the end just to easе my mind
I know it's dark, but it helps
We're mad 'cause she loves you
Wish you could see the other side sometimes
If you question, if you don't want to know
Sometimes I don't want to know
There's some dreams I won't ever get to feel
Roof-down Testarossa, arms swaying in the breeze
There's some things I won't get to relive
Roof-top, arms around each other momentarily
We're alright
What in the world could've changed your mind?
What kind of world do you dream about?
I dreamt of death, and it eased my mind
Baby, don't stress, happens all the time
We misconnect, I don't pay no mind
What kind of world do you leave behind?
I think of the end just to ease my mind
I know it's dark, but it helps
I know it's dark, but it helps
I know it's dark, but it's hell
I know it's dark, but it's hell
I know it's dark, but it hel-

Yeah, bleeding out was such a sweet lie
I forget about it sometimes
Till went forward and it don't stop
Too much time in your own thoughts
The feelings only conspires
All you didn't do is barbed wired
How many times till the last one? One
But we're out of time, ghost town
No one can catch us now
So stumble on your old ways
Past a second in the hallway
Doing nothing, we're better off
Falling right back out of place
Heartbreaks subsides till we're home
Cycle through panic and grace
Compulsion taking control (No harm in feeling afraid)
You're gonna run till it stops
You're gonna fight back tears
I hold my breath from the start
And felt it coming for years
So keep on brеaking my heart
Until it kills me I swear
With еvery second I've lost and exhausting, the love I've bought and sold
Just drifting in and out
Your world, fading
And we're out of time, ghost town
No one can catch us now
And we're out of time, ghost town
No one can catch us now

But baby, it's cold outside, I don't wanna go
Rushing thoughts to the back of my mind
From the end of the road
Always thought I'd find peace in that life
Now I've nowhere to go
Chasing shadows across those blue skies, my heroes
We'll watch the radio blur
As my hands move fast to the mirror
Been fighting off cold sweats
And waking up soaked again
I couldn't fake it if I tried, I couldn't fake it if I, if I
'Cause baby it's cold outside, I don't wanna go
Rushing thoughts to the back of my mind
From the end of the world, woah
Look, baby, I gotta go
'Cause I'm dying for it
So if you love me don't let me go
'Cause I'm dying for it
If you love me don't let me go
'Cause I'm dying for it
If you love me don't let me go
'Cause I'm—

I can feel this dropping
Drunk drive and spoke to God
No fear, all that worry
And you're not moving, but you want it to stop
Daydreamer, goals screenshotted
High speeds sank the sun
Gold dreams of California
So comfortable you need some trouble to cause
But you don't know what you want
So I'll let go of control
'Cause I know just what you are
You're gonna break me in two
Me, no falling back
I can feel this dropping
And when the wheels don't stop
Just, run me over, no, no dialing down now
Only realizing, we're too far forward now, oh
Running out of fuel, I wanted you to hold back
Falling after something that ain't right, right
I don't feel right
Wanted you to know that you can't hold me
You don't know what you want
So I'll let go of control
'Cause I know just what you are
You're gonna, you're going
You're going, you're going, going, going

So rushing in and rushing out again
Another martyr anon
So you can wake up and start again
From stardust to god
And maybe in another man's life
On another man's time
Maybe the time's just not right for us
Maybe this is all that we are, are
The lives I've loved
Too close to know
The hindsight song
There's no way I'd rather wait than know
The highs we trade for the lows
Just gotta wake up and start again
'Cause this is no place like home
And if you could've stayed there you
Would've, could've, should've
Another life I had known
Maybe the time would be right for us
But this is all that we got, our luck
The lives I've loved
And too close to know
Chasing, but at what cost?
Just 'cause there's no way I'd rather wait than know

I told her relax
You might as well relax
'Cause the fear is going down, down, down
I told you to leave
But you never do it
So the fear is going on, on, on
See it coming down, down, down
See it coming down, down, down
And I guess it'll rot away
And I found you here on another day
You were waiting for an old dream
Found you on another day
All is spoken, after that
There's a desert left behind
You're a stranger in a dark room
Holding on to someone new
I am waiting on an old dream
Holding on to someone new, ooh
For a moment, I've been waiting
Stranger in a dark room
See it going down, down, down
Said it's going down, down, down

So, I can— are you recording?
Yeah
So, I can, wait for focus, and— *clap*
And now you can press play if you want
But I'm still putting it in
Yeah
You're dead wrong ('cause I feel like I need to crash)
It's kind of taking me back to like, ah, pick it up (what are we doing?)
Let's go home
There's no hope
It's all wrong
This will kinda take long, fuck, okay
And I got—
Recently, in an interview, someone asked me, uh, "What are the three most important things that have happened to you this year?"
Um, I can't fully remember what I said, but, I'm pretty sure it was something along the lines of, um, "Finishing my album, moving to New York, and, the sh- the live shows I played."
Um, I've been thinking about that question for a while now, though, um, and that those three answers were maybe along the right lines, but, only like half-truths.
Um, finishing my album was important, but, for me, it was, you know, like, bigger than just the submission of some songs that I made in my bedroom.
Um, it's the bookend to a large part of my life, uh, you know—things have been on my mind in some cases probably for too long, um, and in the same way moving to New York was amazing, but, really, it was me jumping out of my comfort zone for a while.
Leaving the people and places and the culture that I had known my whole life behind, even, you know, just for a second.
Um, it wasn't really the live shows I played that were important, but more so, some of the things I learnt while out there.
Uh, I realized I wasn't taking myself into consideration; I was playing shows to please people and to entertain them, and forgot to make sure that I enjoyed it. Um, that I got to feel something more than, used afterwards. Um, and it was just a small shift of mindset but I'm so much better for it.
Um, it seems simple, but it took me a year and a half of touring to, to get it, and it only really happened at the very end of it.
But, most importantly, on tour, I saw another artist in a similar position. Um, I won't say who it was but I had finished performing and went to see someone much bigger than me.
And just before their set started, I saw them sitting down, uh, right beside the steps to their stage, you know, like, moments before one of the most energetic performances I saw this summer.
And they were sitting, hood up, and on their phone. You know, alone, uh, honestly looking quite down, or lost.
I didn't talk to them, but weirdly it was a relief knowing that it wasn't just me, um, that I wasn't the only one.
So I think I should tell you this. This album has been for me since I first started thinking about working on it, years ago.
Um, it just been a catalyst of change in so many ways for me, um, and it's taught me so much more about myself than I ever thought it would.
Um, I made vertigo by myself, for myself, um, but it, but it's finished now.
So, maybe it could be for you.
I have spread my dreams under your feet. Tread softly.

You came in through my window, you left without a sound
You're floating through my ceiling, eyes fixed on the ground
Am I holding you up?
A block in the road, no effort in sinking
Life's always telling you to go
'Cause we're just waiting on a signal, we're looking for a sign
Oblivious to changes, grasping at the time
No hope in searching outward, no truth beyond the line
And melding at the edges, transmuting lost time
Still wherever you go
Love will surround you
Love will surround you
Love will surround you
Love will surround you
Am I holding you up?
A block in the road, no effort in sinking
Life's always telling you to go
'Cause we're just waiting on a signal, we're looking for a sign
Oblivious to changes, grasping at the time
No hope in searching outward, no truth beyond the line
And melding at the edges, transmuting lost time
Still wherever you go
Love will surround you
So let me go if you want, don't let me know that I'm lost
'Cause I just wanna feel wanted
No revolution, no blood, blood, blood
Transmuting, lost time

Nineteen
Inverted baby
Bright blue sky scenes, obscura in my bedroom
Lying on the floor, we had some times
Bad ideas
Soft-spoken music to my ears
Spending my money
I wish I had spent time
But no, our legacy sheets can bring me sweet dreams
How strange is it when ours is lost in them?
I said "whenever you called, I'd be there"
I hope you never take advice from your friends
Crammed into the back seat of my first car that I drove too fast
Running from the thought I
Know you don't gеt it when I say I been ballin'
It's all bless
You couldn't stop crying, I couldn't cry at all
How can I dance mysеlf clean?
These rooms just dirty my soles
Slowly my friends turn to places
I can't be everywhere at once
I watched some friends turn to places
Now it's just a one-way convo
And 'til you're not afraid of going
I'll be right here on your arm
And when it's not my choice in stayin
I'll go
I know our legacy sheets can't bring me sweet dreams
How strange is it when ours is lost in them
I said "whenever you called I'd be there"
I hope you never take advice from your friends
Crammed into the back seat of my first car that I drove too fast running from the thought I
Know you don't get it when I tell you I'm ballin
Ballin'
We were just kids
You couldn't stop crying, I couldn't cry at all
How can I just dance myself clean?
These rooms just dirty my soles
Slowly my friends turn to places
And I can't be everywhere at once
I watched my friends turn to places
And now it's just a one-way convo
Ooh, ooh

Been running for a long time, felt loved for a little while
Been tryna figure out, where I strayed from
Just a glorified logophile
I just found some new words for an old cliché
Now people think I'm wise
But I'm so sick of being so hyper-aware
Of everything I'm saying, of everything I do
Yeah it's obvious this shit ain't working out
I miss feeling unweighted down, down
I used to have everything I needed to be free
But I won't stop you, no I won't stop you
'Cause those final thoughts of light
Watch them flicker into night
No I won't stop you, no I won't stop you
When these words are all forgot
Sing and set fire
Set it on fire, set it on fire
I find it funny how there's always just a new way
Been running out of echoes that surprised me
Keep running off
I keep on dreaming I saw myself in a new life
It's so much, so much easier from the outside
Like why's it always feel like there's a better time away from here?
And I'm so sick of being so hyper-aware
Of everything I'm saying, of everything I do
And yes it's obvious this shit ain't working out
I miss feeling unweighted down, down
But you still have everything you need to be set free
And I won't stop you, no I won't stop you
'Cause those final thoughts of light
Watch them flicker into night
And I won't stop you, no I won't stop you
I'm just so sick of how we tie ourselves engorged in knots
Just to fumble again and again and we don't stop running
Yeah, no we don't stop for nothing at all
I can't stay here in a freeze-frame
Stuck living in a replay
Same smiles but 2D
Is it hopeless to think it don't matter?
'Cause I'm hopeless and it don't matter
I think it's a well-deserved right to be forgotten
I see you slip out from under me
I sink as half the man I used to be
With half the voice that made you sing
And it'll be over, and probably for the best
'Cause I'm dreaming of a way out, rain down
No hard feeling, used to patience, fade out
'Cause I'm dreaming of a way out, rain down
No hard feeling, used to patience, fade out
Ooh, ooh

The song deals with anxious overthinking about regret and lack of confidence.
Touch me and slip away
I can't hide feeling out of place
I can't function, oh my mistake
Thought you were someone I once knew
I was light years ahead of me
Thoughts in my head don't disappear
I was a maybe (A maybe)
That made you the truth
In time I will come to see it for how it really was
In my mind, it's only false faces whisper, “Love you”
If that feeling had a price then I would gladly pay it over and over and over 'til I'm broke
And if you held me for ransom I'd love it, I'd never wanna go home
But all this hypothetical thinking is digging me down (Down)
And maybe I was seconds away but it doesn't matter now
Heat death only seconds away, so no, it don't matter now
何かが消えてしまったという感覚だけが、目覚めてからも、長く、残る
Touch me and slip away
I can't hide feeling out of place
I can't function, oh my mistake
Thought you were someone I once knew, woah, yeah
There's light years ahead of me
Voices in my head don't disappear
I was a maybe (A maybe)
That made you the truth
In time I will come to love it for how it really was
In my mind, it's only false faces whisper, “See you”
If that feeling had a price then I would gladly pay it over and over and over 'til I'm broke
And if you held me for ransom I'd love it, I'd never wanna go home
But all this hypothetical thinking is digging me down, down
And maybe I was seconds away but it doesn't matter now
Heat death only seconds away, so no, it don't matter now

Yeah, how could you be so careless?
I sweat this, I swear
I think I'm losing my voice, I took no time to take care
I smashed my phone, but honestly
I feel relieved you can't reach me
Now I can exhale on my own
What were you thinking? That night was a dream
At the top of your lungs, I've heard you scream in your sleep
And I know you don't mean a thing, I just get lost in translation
So, how much is enough gonna take? Yeah
I got a number for you
I call it breaking, yeah
I've got a lover, baby
Don't need what you're giving me
More than what you think
Oh, love ain't love if it ain't rough
But, you're screaming
I've said it all
(Daydream of nights, sin and saviours)
I thought maybe you'd believe me 'cause I don't
(I saw a light at the end)
These days it's a cliché, I know
(And who am I supposed to be now?)
I have no words, no words
(It's ending)
And if I could forget you, you know I would leave
I can't help myself from feeling all this is wasted on me
And I love the rain (love!), but I can't live in a storm
I've got more to come
Still learning to grow
What were you thinking? That night was a dream
At the top of your lungs, I hear you screaming, no sleep
And I know you don't mean a thing, I just get lost in translation
So, how much is enough gonna take?
I got a lifetime to wait
Seconds can't bury me

You try to kill it but it won't stop bleeding
Try to forget it but it won't stop killing you
You're running out of time
Yeah, you know you can't go back
It's too late
To say it's too late
You can't take back that you said nothing
How could you do nothing?
Is this burning right?
Am I living bridges?
Can we build our past right?
Learning through future solecism
(I've missed times) It's played out
(Been disconnected) I've moved on
(I stressed time) Get fucked up
(Forgetting timing) My new draw
(And I need you to talk me down) And it's not right
You're dead wrong
('Cause I feel like I need to crash) What are we doing?
Let's go home
There's no hope
It's all wrong
'Cause I've been looking at the sky to show me where I went wrong
Been looking at the sky like someone was looking down
But it keeps raining on me
And I've been looking at the sky since I was like five years old
Been looking for the stars, but it seems like they're all gone
And the fault's not ours alone
But I think it's time to go
It's played out
I've moved on
Get fucked up
My new draw
(And I need you to talk me down) And it's not right
You're dead wrong
('Cause I feel like I need to crash) What are we doing?
Let's go home
There's no hope
It's all wrong
And I've got way too many questions just to try and get it right
'Cause I can't be the one to shrug it off
And I could be the reason that we stay up all night
To be someone, to be someone
And oh, all we've got is to try to get it right
But no one told you
That this gon' hurt
Oh no
And now all I really want is to scream
Now all I really want is to scream
Now all I really want is to scream
Now all I really want is to scream
That shit just to try and find a way to get my head down
And head out or maybe just the two of us and head now
I'm just tryna find the real now
Dream clouds, ghost ground
Real friends, dead hometown
'Cause I've been looking at the sky to show me where I went wrong
Been looking at the sky like someone was looking down
But it keeps raining on me
When I been looking at the sky since I was like five years old
Been looking for the stars, but it seems like they're all gone
And it breaks my heart, you know
But I think it's time to go
It's played out
I've moved on
Get fucked up
My new draw
(And I need you to talk me down) And it's not right
You're dead wrong
('Cause I feel like I need to crash) What are we doing?
Let's go home
There's no hope
It's all wrong

Tide rushing in to me, two me ('Til)
'Til I can breathe easy on my knees ('Til)
Comes falling sins, I've been, been, I been ('Til)
Living easy on my knees, on my–
Concaving in the back
Days slipping through the cracks
Call for you in the back, I'll become stoic if I have to
Royce Rollin' in the back, no phone is now a lux
Heartbreaking in the past on me, on me, on me (Me)
The still life projections of you (You)
Diffracting through my skull 'til ('Til)
Tide rushing in to me, two me ('Til)
'Til I can breathe easy on my knees ('Til)
Comes falling sense, I've been, been, I been ('Til)
Living easy on my knees ('Til)
Breathe еasy on me, yeah ('Til)
Sleep easy on mе, on my–
Part 2: XO
Yeah, she's in love with the concept
As if we're all just how she imagined
'Cause we're in love, I just don't know it yet, huh
Well, tell me how am I supposed to see the magic?
'Cause I don't believe in it no more
But I won't tell her
'Cause I always imagined
It's easier if she thinks she won
So I'ma let her, and she said
"I don't think I love you no more
You never seem to call me lately" ('Til)
Girl, I don't think you know me at all
'Cause I never thought I'd have to say this ('Til)
No I don't love you, and I never did
Look at us burning down in flames for kicks ('Til)
But just know
I'm not singing for your XO (Breathe easy on me)
I'm just singing 'cause it's over, yeah
Breathe easy on me
I'm just singing 'cause it's over, yeah
Breathe easy on me
I'm just singing 'cause it's over

Reflections, of my dash aligning stars over shoulder
Inflections, tell me you don't really mean what you say
That you were in love, love, love
(I don't want it, baby, I keep falling)
You're screaming and bursting heads
Breathing corrupted air (Tell me I'm back at it since)
Your cigarette's going out, dear
(Help me down, I can't sleep)
Mayfair and lip fillers
Heartbreak and coke dealers
You were in love, love, love (It's cold feet)
But since you're on your way out
Living fast, I capsize amazed now
Leave a message when you go
(You're leaving, leave me out, me out)
I, I had a dream that you wanted me
I still see you with my eyes closed
I don't think you understand how brilliant you burned
Does your past feel complete now I'm here?
Versions of another version you've seen
(I see you, I see you running on)
When I calm down, I'll be long gone (I'm going)
Just stop

Whatever you want, calling my style
Lever down, fall on my head
What you  talking 'bout nothing
And you never delve deep
No, you're going for nothing
Uh, uh
Whatever you want, calling my style
Lever down, fall on my head
What you  talking 'bout nothing
And you never delve deep
No, you're going for nothing
Uh, uh
Oof, yeah
We were talking on the phone
I can't hear you
She said we're breaking up
Guess it mustn't be important anyway
Later when we talk through
We have thе best fuck
But she don't really hеar what I'm trying to say
Dripping on my bedsheets
Now the air's thick, and the skin temp
And the sweat beads, she said I like that
Listening to moonlight, I don't think twice
She said that's a breach of trust, tryna breach the peace
And the sound flows, I'll show you how to fight
Now she acting distant, like this sort of tune
Everybody on my call like a
I only like who I am half of the time
I just wanna feel you on my side, by my side
Making mistakes and I'll take you for a ride
With the feelings gone, can we make it all right?
Can we make it?
Can we make it?
Can we make it?
Whatever you want, calling my style
Lever down, fall on my head
What you  talking 'bout nothing
And you never delve deep
No, you're going for nothing
Uh, uh
Whatever you want, calling my style
Lever down, fall on my head
What you  talking 'bout nothing
And you never delve deep
No, you're going for nothing
Uh, uh

A violent type of end
Waking up heartbroken
Losing all my friends
A last gasp of air
Before going under
But what on Earth is left for me?
I've been on Merseyside
Braced Mulholland Drive
Saharan dunes and Irish skies
I've heard Argentine birds
And panorama sunrise
You were supposed to meet me
At Park Hyatt at nine
In the end I only moved out of love
Don't you ever get tired of all that talk?
I could spend the rest of my life out here
I don't plan on living that long anyway (way)
What a fucking clown
I'm still laughing
But these tears ain't from laughter
These tears ain't got no answers
These tears won't bring them back
Bridge no gaps (no)
Take no breaks (no)
Fill no cracks (no)
Take my hand, drag me out
I thought I was holding on
And I thought I was holding on
I thought-

But I could be more
Isn't there more?
Don't you dream of forgetting this?
Have we forgotten what we want?
Counting the wars
And broken bones
Haven't we lost enough already?
Isn't this more than what it's worth?
Have we forgotten where we came from?
Long way from laying in the dirt
And if I can only dream of up from down there
God, help me, I'll be gone
Have I lost sight of everything I've worked for?
Did I get this all wro—?

Its a cold ocean
Another dream showing me new ways
I had a dream
There was no escape
You hit me back in your own way
I ate that karma
Now debts paid
Eye for an eye
We saw each other change
Orbits we had decoupled, in decay
Then a couple years show me new sides of familiar faces
We fell out of touch out of sync it chafed
Fell on my face hit you for commiserations
The tee shirt said the heart had changed
