Young man shows his age
Judge man named it sin
Bad man don' exist no

But your mother would be proud of you
I bet your mother would be proud of you
The beast will crawl this earth
Then fall in the dirt to feed the crows
They'll rip apart his flesh
'Til all that's left is glorious bone
So you'll bury your own
Too vain
You saw it unfold
What you know
And you claimed all you could hold
Until death did you part from the mess you made
I bet your mother would be proud of you
I bet your mother would be proud of you
Primate sharpens tool
To survive and thrive in the jungle
Maybe hearts were made to pump blood
Maybe lungs were made for flood
I won't blunt my blade for cut these chains
Rather let my limbs be drug through mud
You're my brother but your eyes are cold
You're my sister but your womb is bare
I bet our mother would be proud of you
I bet our mother would be proud of you
Bad man don't exist
No evil man exists
I know good man don't exist

Gonna be somebody, I follow
Running showers, in a mist so cloudy
Enough time to know, know nothing at all
I see the lines (Walls)
There's two lines (Walls)
You'll live a life anew
Tell me what you need from me? Gas money?
And I did what I needed to, yeah
To be kind
Cut your teeth on sheets in Paris
Hope the water's deep enough
It's a rush to the head
We've been here before (He's just like the water)
The first time is not the past time
I ain't felt this way in years
First, I was rushing for a wait
This time, I'm waiting for a rush
(Oh, help me up off my feet, yeah)
Infatuation's your rush (Help me, help me, help me off my feet, yeah)
(Do you wish you were me?)
Keep pushing on 'em, never let 'em stop (Do you wish you were me?)
All what happens to be, now it happens to me
Upon his feet
Twin peaking, highs and lows
We shaded off and on (Up on his feet)
Bygones, but we're still here
Riding in my two wheels
I love the way you make me feel (I'll be up in a week)
Bet you wish you was me?
Might need some help on my feet
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I be up to my feet
I'll wake up in a week
Wake me up in a week
(It's like driving 'round, stroke me, suck me, pipe me down)
(Two is a crowd, quieting down)
(Bite me down, pad me down, do whatever to fly me down)
What stays and what—
What's gone and what's here still?
And what's here still?
Riding my two wheels
They're gone and you're still here, ridin'
They're gone and you're still here, riding my two wheels
I love the way you make me feel

My girl made him wait 'til the hours of the night
Then hit you with the, "You know it's mid, right?"
Can't be on time for the free rides
Can't be my type, I'm a low life
Crammed in some time, now I'm your whole life
Can't make those calls in the low light, I—
Are you ready to go?
We gon' be waitin' in line
Yeah, you look good
Would I fuck? Yeah
Did I? Almost
Back home with that "almost"
Back home with that "next time"
Bags with all that Rally's in 'em
Trades with all the valley
Top chopped down like blades came through the valley
Freeway
Despite our history
Somewhere in your nights, you're stuck when you think of me
Despite the life I lead
All this life in me
Spirits watch me pants down
Can't be 'barrassed of it
I feel their smiles on me (Smiles on me)
I feel their smiles on me (Smile on me)

Backseat, spacious, I pulled up, spaceship, yeah (Turn it)

Dear April
The only face in the crowd that I know
Dear April
Are you watching him?
Are you watching him dance?
Dear April
We were safe for a while
We were safe as the years flew by
If you could take two strangers
Leaning left and right
At a certain place and time
Like you took these strangers
And our two strange lives
And made us new
And took us through
And woke us up
I believe that no matter what
It make us new
Take us through it
And wake us up again
What we had won't be the same now (Same now)
But you will make something new
And it'll take you through this
If you can take two strangers
Leaning left and right
At a certain place and time
Like you took these strangers
And our two strange lives
And made us new
And took us through
And woke us up
I believe no matter what
Take us through it
And wake us up again
And what we had can't be the same now (Now, now)
But you will make something
It'll take you through
It'll wake you up again
Just like you made me new (You made me new)
Just like you took me through (Took me through it)
Just like you woke me up (Woke me up, yeah)
You made me new
You took me through
You woke me up (Woke me up)
Dear April
Are you watching him dance?
Dear April
Are you watching him dance?

I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you love me
The start of nothin'
I had no chance to prepare, I couldn't see you comin'
The start of nothin'
Ooh, I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
When we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good
If I could see through walls, I could see you're fakin'
If you could see my thoughts, you would see our faces
Safe in my rental like an armored truck back then
We didn't give a fuck back then
I ain't a kid no more
We'll never be those kids again
We'd drive to Syd's
Had the X6 back then, back then
No matter what I did, my waves wouldn't dip back then
Everything sucked back then, we were friends
I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you love me
The start of nothin'
I had no chance to prepare, I couldn't see you comin'
The start of nothin'
Ooh, I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
But we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good
In the halls of your hotel
Arm around my shoulder so I could tell
How much I meant to you, meant it sincere back then
We had time to kill back then
You ain't a kid no more, we'll never be those kids again
It's not the same, ivory's illegal, don't you remember?
I broke your heart last week
You'll probably feel better by the weekend
Still remember, had you going crazy
Screamin' my name, the feeling deep down is good
I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you love me
The start of nothin'
Had no chance to prepare, couldn't see you comin'
And we started from nothin'
Ooh, I could hate you now
It's alright to hate me now
We both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good
All the things I didn't mean to say, I didn't mean to do
There were things you didn't need to say, did you mean to? Mean to?
I've been dreamin' of you, dreamin' of you
I've been dreamin' of you, dreamin' of you
I've been dreamin', dreamin'

Ayy
Ayy, so now I'm
So low that I can see under the skirt of an ant
So low that I don't get high no more
When I "Geronimo," I just go, "Heh"
Solo, my cup is a rojo, my cholo, my friend
So low that I can admit
When I hear that another kid is shot by the popo
It ain't an event no more
So low that no more high horses, so hard to wear Polo
When I do, I cut the pony off
Now there's a hole where there once was a logo, how fitting
So low that I can give a fuck about what is trending
Tryna cut down on my spending
Regardless of winning, instead of pretending
And bending over backwards
Over half of these hoes had work done
Sayin' they want something real from a man
Just saying it, we being real persons
I hate that it's like this, I feel for you, ant
I don't know what it's like with a skirt on
So pardon me if I am being insensitive
But darling, this only worsens
So low my halo stay way low, it feels like it's bent
So low that when they throw pussy or pesos
Don't pay no attention to it
So low that I am no rookie, but feel like a kid
Lookin' at the other kids
With astonishment while I'm on punishment
Watchin' the summer come close to an end
After twenty years in, I'm so naive I was under the im—
'Pression that everyone wrote they own verses
It's comin' back different, and yeah, that shit hurts me
I'm hummin' and whistlin' to those not deserving
I've stumbled and lived every word, was I working
Just way too hard?

The dance went on.. I kept the rhythm for several summers after. It's winter now. I'm typing this on a plane back to Los Angeles from New Orleans. I flew home for another marred Christmas. I have a windowseat. It's December 27, 2011. By now I've written two albums. This being the second. I wrote to keep myself busy and sane. I wanted to create worlds that were rosier than mine. I tried to channel overwhelming emotions. I'm surprised at how far all of it has taken me. Before writing this I'd told some people my story. I'm sure these people kept me alive, kept me safe. Sincerely, these are the folks I wanna thank from the floor of my heart. Everyone of you knows who you are.. Great humans, probably angels. I don't know what happens now, and that's alrite. I don't have any secrets I need kept anymore. There's probably some small shit still, but you know what I mean. I was never alone, as much as it felt like it. As much as I still do sometimes. I never was. I don't think I ever could be. Thanks. To my first love, I'm grateful for you. Grateful that even though it wasn't what I hoped for and even though it was never enough, it was. Some things never are.. and we were. I won't forget you. I won't forget the summer. I'll remember who I was when I met you. I'll remember who you were and how we've both changed and stayed the same. I've never had more respect for life and living than I have right now. Maybe it takes a near death experience to feel alive. Thanks. To my mother. You raised me strong. I know I'm only brave because you were first. So thank you. All of you. For everything good. I feel like a free man. If I listen closely.. I can hear the sky falling too.

Double D, big full breasts on my baby (Yo, we goin' to Florida)
Triple weight, couldn't weigh the love I've got for the girl
And I just wanna know, why you ain't been goin' to work?
Boss ain't workin' you like this, he can't take care of you like this
Now you're lost, lost in the heat of it all
Girl, you know you're lost, lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India, lost on a train, lost
Got on my buttercream silk shirt, and it's Versace (There he goes, one of God's own prototypes)
Hand me my triple weight, so I can weigh the work I got on you, girl (Too weird to live and too rare to die)
No, I don't really wish, I don't wish the titties would show
No, have I ever, have I ever let you get caught? (Oh)
Lost, lost in the heat of it all
Girl, you know you're lost, lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India, lost on a train, lost
She's at a stove (Who?), can't believe I got her out here cookin' dope (Cookin' dope)
I promise she'll be whippin' meals up for a family of her own some day
Nothin' wrong, no, nothin' wrong with a lie (Nothin' wrong, ain't nothin' wrong, ooh)
Nothin' wrong with another short plane ride through the sky, you and I (Ain't nothin' wrong, ain't nothin' wrong, up in the sky, just you and I)
Lost (Ooh), lost in the heat of it all
Girl, you know you're lost (Ooh), lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Spain, lost (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Los Angeles, India, lost on a train, lost (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Love lost, lost
Love, love, love lost, lost
Love, love, love lost
Love, love, love lost

Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no Lucky Charms
The maids come around too much
Parents ain't around enough
Too many joy rides in daddy's Jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothin' but loose ends
Super rich kids with nothin' but fake friends
Start my day up on the roof
There's nothing like this type of view
Point the clicker at the tube
I prefer expensive news
New car, new girl, new ice, new glass
New watch, good times, babe, it's good times, yeah
She wash my back three times a day
This shower head feels so amazin'
We'll both be high, the help don't stare
They just walk by, they must don't care
A million one, a million two
A hundred more will never do
Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no Lucky Charms
The maids come around too much
Parents ain't around enough
Too many joy rides in daddy's Jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothin' but loose ends
Super rich kids with nothin' but fake friends
Real love
I'm searchin' for a real love
Oh, real love
I'm searchin' for a real love
Oh, real love
Alright, close your eyes for what you can't imagine
We are the Xanny-gnashin', Caddy-smashin' bratty ass
He mad, he snatched his daddy's Jag and used the shit for batting practice
Adamant and he thrashin'
Purchasing crappy grams with half the hand of cash you handed
Panic and patch me up
Pappy done latch-keyed us
Toyin' with Raggy Anns, and mammy done had enough
Brash as fuck, breachin' all these aqueducts
Don't believe us, treat us like we can't erupt, yeah
We end our day up on the roof
I say I'll jump, I never do
But when I'm drunk, I act a fool
Talkin' 'bout, do they sew wings on tailored suits?
I'm on that ledge, she grabs my arm
She slaps my head, it's good times, yeah
Sleeve rips off, I slip, I fall
The market's down like sixty stories
And some don't end the way they should
My silver spoon has fed me good
A million one, a million cash
Close my eyes and feel the crash
Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no Lucky Charms (Ah)
The maids come around too much
Parents ain't around enough (Uh-uh, uh)
Too many joy rides in daddy's Jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothin' but loose ends

Real love, real love, yeah
Real love (Real love)
I'm searchin' for a real love
Talkin' 'bout a real love (Oh, ooh, ooh)
A fantastic product—
Killing—

My right hand to God
Left hand holding the jewels
And I'm swearing up and down
The tide stole my youth
The creases in my brow ain't tan lines
Saltwater swole my eyes
The sun burnt me black and blue
Too cold this side of June
It ain't natural
Right hand in yours
Left hand holding the jewels
When that jungle flower blooms
Better leave it in the ground
Don't try to cut it out
The creases in your brow ain't tan lines
Saltwater swole my eyes
The sun burnt you black and blue on your green eyes
Too cold this side of June
That ain't natural
I'll rebel, I'll rebel
But this ain't natural
I'll take care, I'll take care
If this ain't going well
I'm no match for you
This isn't hard to tell
That it ain't going well
When we're under the palm trees
Thinking heaven must be
Somewhere under these palm trees
With all the hell we're raising
At least we had the palm trees
To save us from the ray beams
But not even the palm trees
Could save us from the flames
Summer remains, ooh
Oh, summer remains
Oh yeah, summer remains
Summer remains

When I feel what I feel
Sometimes it's hard to tell you so
You may not be in the mood to learn
What you think you know
There are times when I find
You wanna keep yourself from me
When I don't have the strength
I'm just a mirror of what I see
But at your best, you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
If you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know
Love
When you feel what you feel
It's hard for me to understand
So many things have taken place before this love affair began
But if you feel more like I feel
Confusion can give way to doubt
For there are times when I fall short of what I say
What I say I'm all about, all about
But at your best, you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know
Love
(Wait, waiting)
Let me know
(You niggas goin' in)
Tell me what it is (Fuck it)
What it is, no need to make believe
Look beyond your world
Try to find, find a place for me
'Cause when you're at your best, you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know
Let me know, know
Love
Stay at your best, baby
Let me know, let me know

Darker times (Oh my God, this is my song)
They're telling boulder-heavy lies (Don't play with me right now, what?)
Looks like all we've got is each other (Ah)
The truth is obsolete (Yes, I can listen to it)
Remember when all I had was my mother (Haha, let them sing)
She didn't compromise
She could recognize
Voodoo
Our daughters and our sons (See, all that is unnecessary)
Are just candles in the sun (Mmcht, huh, haha)
Voodoo
Don't let him see divide, hmm (I'm just playin', so tell me how I skate? What you mean?)
Don't you let her see divide (You said you could tell a lot about a man by the way he skates, so how do I skate?)
Voodoo (I don't know, just be real)
She's got the whole wide world in her juicy fruit (You, you're alright, heh)
He's got the whole wide world in his pants (There's somethin' about you, huh, I don't know)
He wrapped the whole wide world in a wedding band (I can't believe I'm even talking to you and telling you this right now)
Then put the whole wide world on her hands
She's got the whole wide world in her hands (You special, heh, I don't know about that)
He's got the whole wide world in his hands (I wish you could see what I see, hmm)
In his hands (*kiss*)
He wrapped the whole wide world in a wedding band
Then put the whole wide world on her hands
(She's got the whole wide world in her hands)

Mosh pits and bare chest

I think I need a cold shower
Cool waters
African girl speaks in English accent
Likes to fuck boys in bands
Likes to watch Westerns
And ride me without the hands
Show me her passport
She's on her own tour
But you're beautiful to me, ooh
Wave 'em high, girl, to the sky
But you're beautiful to me, oh (Woah)
We're in the clouds
Wave 'em high, girl, to the sky
But you're beautiful to me, oh (Woah)
Life in the clouds
Keep em high, y'all
Beautiful stars in the sky

Stage divin' Dalai Lama
Feet covered in cut flowers
They mosh for enlightenment
Clean chakra, good karma
Oh, one with the water
Indian girl sleeps above the temple
Plannin' a runaway, young at heart
You found a boyfriend
And now you wanna get away, get away
Just a virgin lover on a getaway, get away
And at sunset, they're gonna try and get away, get away
Abhayamudra
I never ask for much
But please keep up, lover
We've got no choices left
The runnin's fast
Run, run, run, run
You're beautiful to me
Run, run, run, run, you'd better run
You mean so much to me
In my world, my world
We made it safely
Even with your father's army trailin' us
We escaped him
Even with his archers' bows at our backs
What a great escape (Oh, wow)
But there's a long way still, in fact (Ooh)
We're lost in a jungle, underneath these clouds
There's a monsoon that never ends
A coke-white tiger woke us from our slumber
To guide and protect us 'til the end
Woah, we're in the clouds
Wave 'em high now, to the sky
But you're beautiful to me, oh
Keep 'em high, y'all, show you right
But you're beautiful to me, oh
Right, beautiful

And the peaches and the mangos that you could sell for me
What do you think my brain is made for?
Is it just a container for the mind?
This great grey matter
Sensei replied, "What is your woman?
Is she just a container for the child?"
That soft pink matter
Cotton candy, Majin Buu, ooh, ooh, ooh
Close my eyes and fall into you, you, you
My God, she's giving me pleasure
Oh, no, no
What if the sky and the stars are for show?
And the aliens are watching live
From the purple matter?
Sensei went quiet, then violent
And we sparred until we both grew tired
Nothin' mattered
Cotton candy, Majin Buu, oh, oh, oh
Dim the lights and fall into you, you, you
My God, giving me pleasure
Pleasure, pleasure, pleasure
Pleasure over matter
Hey, hey (Yeah, ha)
Doesn't matter if she wanna be with me, so it's cool
I make her call me B.B. King because I give her the blues
But not on purpose though, she was the perfect ho-stess
When I come over, we would do the grossest
Most beautiful-est things on a bed of roses
You were the coldest when you hit the hardwood floor
We sippin' 'gnac, not mimosas
She's in my naked lap, goin' HAM like she supposed to
And she could make it clap if I told her
Or make her ass spread like the back of a cobra
Standin' at attention like a soldier
A G.I. Joe, man, see me, I go in (Ass, bitch, nigga)
Yeah, that nigga goes up in it
Like smoke through a chimney
Slow stroke, 'cause she feelin' me up in her, nigga (Hey, hey)
Killing me softly, raw dog, she wants me
Strong and black like her coffee, get off me
Act a donkey, I pin her tail to the mattress
I've been a player, make her go from classy to nasty
Nasty, nasty, nasty, nasty (Ha, ha, ha)
To sloosh (Hey, hey)
Since you been gone, I been having withdrawals
You were such a habit to call
I ain't myself at all, had to tell myself, "Nah
She better with some fella with a regular job"
I didn't wanna get her involved
By dinner, Mr. Benjamin was sittin' in awe
Hopped into my car, drove far
Far's too close, and I remember my memory's no sharp
Butter knife, what a life, anyway
I'm building y'all a clock, stop, what am I, Hemingway?
She had the kind of body that would probably intimidate
Any of 'em that were un-southern, not me, cousin
If models are made for modelin'
Thick girls are made for cuddlin'
Switch worlds and we can huddle then
Who needs another friend? I need to hold your hand
You'd need no other man, we'd flee to other lands
Grey matter
Blue used to be my favorite color
Now I ain't got no choice
Blue matter
You're good at being bad (Ooh, yeah)
You're bad at being good (Ah-ha, oh)
For heaven's sakes, go to hell (Ah-ha)
Knock, knock on wood, hey (Ah-ha-ah)
You're good at being bad (You're bad at being good)
You're bad at being good (For heaven's sakes, go to hell, knock on wood)
For heaven's sakes, go to hell (Would have ya)
Knock, knock, knock, knock on wood
Well, frankly, when that ocean so mu'fuckin' good
Make her swab the mu'fuckin' wood
Make her walk the mu'fucking plank
Make her rob a mu'fucking bank
With no mask on and a rusty revolver

Hell yeah
A blind boy sees a green girl
She drives a green car through a dream world
She meets up with a green club
And talks of saving the Earth from itself
A blind boy saw a blue man
Who rides a blue bus through a nightmare
He leaves word to a blue home
But the blue seems different since she's passed away
And the same boy with sunken eyes saw me
And described yellow so perfectly
Said he's watching (Ooh)
Watching (Ooh)
Watching (Ooh)
With eyes like sky
Eyes like I've never seen
A blind boy became a kind man
Who painted white lights on a canvas
He once said he didn't write songs
Cause making music would be selfish
And back then he saw the flags fly
Seen them fight and divide for it
He said war is for those who foresee it
But what good is border to me, yeah, yeah
And the same man with sunken eyes saw me
And described yellow so perfectly
Said he's watching
Watching
Watching
With eyes like sky
Eyes like I've never seen
I said "I wish you could see the ocean"
He said "I wish you could see hope"
I said "Have you ever seen the mountain?"
He said "No, but my faith could move those"
Oh, woah
I said "I wish you could see the stars"
He told me I should see love
Love
Oh, yeah
Said he's watching
Watching
Watching
With eyes like sky
Eyes like I've never seen

I wanna see your pom-poms from the stands
Come on, come on
My fingertips and my lips
They burn from the cigarettes
Forrest Gump
You run my mind, boy
Runnin' on my mind, boy
Forrest Gump
I know you, Forrest
I know you wouldn't hurt a beetle
But you're so buff and so strong
I'm nervous, Forrest
Forrest Gump
My fingertips and my lips
They burn from the cigarettes
Forrest Gump
You run my mind, boy
Runnin' on my mind, boy
Forrest Gump
I saw your game, Forrest (All eyes are on number forty-four)
I was screaming, "Run, forty-four"
But you kept running past the end zone (He just be the stupidest son of a bitch alive)
Oh, where'd you go, Forrest? (Sure is fast)
Forrest Gump
My fingertips and my lips
They burn from the cigarettes
Forrest Gump
You run my mind, boy
Runnin' on my mind, boy
Forrest Gump
Forrest green (Run)
Forrest blues (Run, Forrest)
I'm remembering you (Run)
This is love, I know it's true
I won't forget you (You)
You, you, oh, you, you
It's for you, Forrest (Oh, na-na-na)
It's you, you, oh, you, you
It's for you, Forrest
Forrest Gump



I believe Jehovah Jireh
I believe there's heaven, I believe in war
I believe a woman's temple
Gives her the right to choose, but baby, don't abort
I believe that marriage isn't
Between a man and woman, but between love and love
And I believe you when you say that you've lost all faith
But you must believe in something, something, something
You gotta believe in something, something, something
I still believe in man
A wise one asked me why
'Cause I just don't believe we're wicked
I know that we sin, but I do believe we try
We all try, the girls try, the boys try
Women try, men try
You and I try, try
We all try
I don't believe in time travel
I don't believe our nation's flag is on the moon
I don't believe our lives are simple
And I don't believe they're short, this is interlude
I don't believe my hands are cleanly
Can't believe that you would let me touch your heart
She didn't believe me when I said that I lost my faith
You must believe in something, something, something
You gotta believe in something, something, something, oh, oh
I still believe in man (Oh, oh)
A wise one asked me why (Oh, oh)
'Cause I just don't believe we're wicked (Wicked)
I know that we sin, but I do believe we try (Try, try)
We all try, the girls try, the boys try
Women try, men try (Every girl tries)
You and I try (Every boy tries), try
We all try
Try to believe
Try (Just try)
Try to believe, try to believe
Try (Just try)
Try to believe, try to believe
Try (Just try)
Try to believe
Oh, I, I do believe, I do believe

No hablará de mí, ni hablará de esto
Lo que él quiere de ti, yo no se lo negaría
Si esto no me ha partío, ya no me partiré nunca
Si puedo soportar lo que siento, ¿por qué me 'toy cayendo?
You stood me up, you laid me down
You know too much, I can't be proud
I still really, really love you, yes, I do
When I still really, really love you, like I do
If you won't, then I will
If you can't, then I will
Is it love to keep it from you?
No hablará de mí, ni hablará de esto
Lo que él quiere de ti, yo no se lo negaría
Si esto no me ha partío, ya no me partiré nunca
Si puedo soportar lo que siento, ¿por qué me 'toy cayendo?
¿Acaso voy cayendo?
You stood me up, you lay me down
You know too much (Too much), I can't be proud
I still really, really love you, yes, I do

Over where the trees burned down
The place where the fields went down in flames
We could put a hole in the ground
Throw seeds and dance for rain
It takes a mind to worry
A conscience to feel ashamed
But there's no place to hide out here
These skies are filled with planes
And both our hands are filthy
Pointing up at the moon
All tonight, I'll hold you close, close enough to bruise
Hope a garden grows where we danced this afternoon
Hope our children walk by spring when flowers bloom
Hope they'll get to see my color
Know that I've enjoyed sunshine
Pray they'll get to see me, me wither (When I was young)
See me wither (When I was young)
Know that—(Me)
Enjoyed sunshine (When I was young)
You know it happens all—(Me)
Know that I've enjoyed sunshine (Me)
You know it happens all—(Me)—all the time (Me)
You know it happens all—(Me)—all the time (Me)
When I was young (Me, me)

Oh, yes
Oh, slide
Xenon's with the blue color
If that's a lease, least it look cool on you
That's your business, and I'm off, when I'm on you
Like holidays, I get off on you

Oh, wait a minute baby girl can we just sit down
There's a couple things we need to talk about
Like when you get mad at me, do you really mean what you say?
Or is it just one of them days, when things ain't goin' your way?
Can we talk about it without the shouting?
I know we got issues, don't wanna lose you
Can't let this thing fall apart
Know it damn well that I got your heart
Think its time to rewind and start all over again
Everybody has their arguments
We all have issues that we need to deal with, can we talk about it?
But that don't mean we can't get over it
Cause It won't be the last time, can't be the last time
With two hearts, one future girl I know its hard
But we can't let it go, cause they wanna see us apart
What I'm saying is, there'll be ups and down
But It won't be the last time, can't be the last time
Can't be the last time, that you get mad at me
For forgetting every little anniversary
Something silly like me leaving up the toilet seat
And it can't be the last time, when you say I don't do this
When you say I don't do that, but you know I ain't perfect
Got no way to explain it, but I know we can make it
I know we got issues, I don't wanna lose you
Can't let this thing fall apart
Know it damn well that I got your heart
Think its time to rewind and start all over again
Everybody has there arguments
We all have issues that we need to deal with, can we talk about it?
But that don't mean we can't get over it
Cause it won't be the last time, can't be the last time
With two hearts, one future girl I know its hard
But we can't let it go, cause they wanna see us apart
What I'm saying is, there'll be ups and down
But It won't be the last time, can't be the last time
Girl, I love the things you do
Reminds me of the reasons why I'm with you
Like when you walk out the door, when your clothes hit the floor
You were just about to break up, and now we 'bout to make up (yeah yeah)
Uh oh oh, oh oh oh ooh woah
Girl just say yeah
Oh oh oh oh, let's make up, oh
Everybody has their arguments
We all have issues that we need to deal with, can we talk about it?
But that don't mean we can't get over it
Cause it won't be the last time, can't be the last time
With two hearts, one future girl I know its hard
But we can't let it go, cause they wanna see us apart
What I'm saying is, there'll be ups and down
But it won't be the last time, it can't be the last time

Miss you so bad, miss you so
We didn't make love
We celebrated its invention (Yeah)

Along with my hard drive (No, no)
No notes, no goodbye
How the hell am I supposed to remember?
Ooo, tell me now, I got the memories
But memories don't last
What am I gonna show to my kids, baby? Yeah, yeah, ooo

No record of the love we had, or (With flash)
My Nikon wasn't fast enough (With flash, with with with flash)
To catch my heart break in half
No smiles on my picture frame, no (With flash)
Just got them
Little basic ones that the pictures frames come with (With flash)
Models, wedding pictures, you know (With flash, with with with flash)
That’s why I was always taking pictures, pictures (Oh, baby)
'Cause I didn't wanna miss a thing, miss a thing
Tell me how could you take the pictures, pictures? (Ooo)

Am I in this by myself? Yeah, hey, yeah

To see something other than these blues and grays
I need something different, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah

Time to drive and think, time to park and cry
You shoulda known you were beautiful

American tears
American heartbreak
Oh, oh, oh
I took a walk with the palm trees
As the daylight fell
Sangria in a canteen
Talking to myself (I can't remember)
This tattoo on my left hand
Is turning purple-ish blue
Daydreams of the romance
Daydreams of you (You)
My pretty woman in a ballgown
I'm Richard Gere in a tux
Getting married in a courthouse
Writing vows in a rush
Making out before the judge
With my teenage wife
Got a wedding band done
That I just might die with
It's an American wedding
They don't mean too much
But we were so in love
We had an American wedding
Now what's mine is yours
That's American law
M-R-S dot Kennedy
She signed her name in pen (Oh)
In the fancy, fancy cursive (Oh)
Then turned her term papers in (Oh, oh)
A thesis on Islamic (Oh)
Virgin brides and arranged marriage (Ah, ah)
Hijabs and polygamist husbands
Those poor un-American girls
After school she ran to me
Jumped in my 5.0
This is the home of the brave, land of the free
But your parents still didn't know (Oh)
She said, "I've had a hell of a summer
So, baby, don't take this hard
But maybe we should get an annulment
Before this goes way too far" (Oh)
It's just an American wedding
They don't mean too much
They don't last enough
We had an American wedding
Now what's mine is yours
American divorce
Well, you can have my Mustang
That's all I've got in my name
But Jesus Christ, don't break my heart
This wedding ring won't ever wipe off
But if you stay
Oh, if you stay (Stay)
You'll probably leave later, anyway

Purple Act', I'm moving like a snail
Both sides even like equal
Both eyes leaning like a scale
Green and blue, hundreds turning teal
Green and blue, money-colored tales
Was such a good guy to Chanel
'Til she caught me sleeping with Charel
Lorraine Schwartz ring like Pharrell
Bling so she see that I'm for real
Picture me, a fire burn in Hell
Photography like David LaChapelle
Black lapels and nappy ponytail
Make 'em call me Flacko Lagerfeld
I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel
Swimming laps through pool water
Heated like I'm underworld
I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel
Swimming laps through pool water
Heated like I'm underworld

This is joy, this is summer
Keep alive, stay alive
Got your metal on (Ooh), we're alone
Making sweet love, takin' time
'Til God strikes us
That's a pretty fuckin' fast year flew by
That's a pretty long third gear in this car
Glidin' on the 5
The deer run across, kill the headlights
Pretty fuckin', underneath moonlight now
Pretty fuckin', sunrise in sight
In comes the mornin', hauntin' us with the beams
Solstice ain't as far as it used to be
It begins to blur, we get older (Blur)
Summer's not as long as it used to be
Every day counts like crazy (Smoke, haze, wait)
Wanna get soaked?
Wanna film a tape on a speed boat?
We smell of Californication (Strike a pose)
Everything grows in the Congo, everything grows (Ooh)
Can you come when I call again?
On comes the evenin', gold seekin' ends
Piece in my hand worth twice than a friend
And two limbs over shoulder, carried away
Because I'm stronger, the Congo is dim (Smoke)
In comes the mornin', ah (Smoke)
In comes the mornin', ah (Haze)

Now, to the edge, I'll race
To the end, I'll make it
All the risk, I'll take it
Headbang with my faux friends
We pour a taste out for the dead
This is the blood, the body
The life right now
The height right now
Might be what I need
Might be what I need
Said you wanna hurt me now
You can't hurt me now
That might be what you need
What it means to be alive (Now)
On this side (You wanna kill me now)
On this side (Don't let me down)
On this side (Down, down)
Fuck the other side (Now)
I'm on this side
I'm on this side
I'm on this side (Now)
How it feels to have arrived
I'm inside
I'm inside
Those are my niggas for life (Now)
Mothers of us, be kind
To the fathers on whom we rely
Fathers of us, be kind
To the mothers on whom we rely (Now)
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah
We know you're sugar
We know you're sweet like a sucker
Pretty sweet
Pretty sweet

No sleeper seats, that's a mattress
No sleeper seats, that's a mattress
You ain't stingy, split your tablets with me
You won't flinch when camera's flashing, flashing
Not fake laid back, no, it's natural
And I think you made for the life I lead
I'm not fake patient, I don't fake sick, huh
That kinda coffin don't need lean
Rest in peace
Got this lust for life in me, yeah
Horny for the game, uh
First they kiss, then they bite soft, uh
Then that bitch wanna play it off, huh
Fuck it, I'm pretty still in a pit of snakes
While serpents shake some brand-new scales
I need a new face, I'm tired of these weirdos acting familiar
Took all the rock and turned it to pop, he think that he Elvis
And he ungrateful, they don't say thank you
They don't say grace, not even for meals, not even for millions
Fuck it, I'm pretty still, look at my deal
Richard Mille, look at my ears, flooded with diamonds
Look at my skills, running through blocks like 49ers
Forty-nine diamonds stuffed in my bracelet
That cost a whop, that cost a whopper
And it ain't new, I had a knot at John Ehret in my locker
Pretty still, it ain't no pretty pill, it's either real or real
Real easy on the eyes, green like a soccer field
Skin hot when they tried me, like them poppers feel
Hands shaking, norepinephrine levels skyrocket, fuel, rocket
Quit being violent with me (Yeah, why, why)
Quit being violent with me
Quit being violent with me
You make me violent
My room, my room, my room (With me)
Every night you were in my room
My room, my room (With me)
I guess I can't state my feelings too soon
I don't know you
And I can't put no threats in the air

My girl made him wait 'til the hours of the night
Then hit you with the, "You know it's mid, right?"
Can't be on time for the free rides
Can't be my type, I'm a low life
Crammed in some time, now I'm your whole life
Can't make those calls in the low light, I—
Are you ready to go?
We gon' be waitin' in line
Yeah, you look good
Would I fuck? Yeah
Did I? Almost
Back home with that "almost"
Back home with that "next time"
Bags with all that Rally's in 'em
Trades with all the valley
Top chopped down like blades came through the valley
Freeway
Despite our history
Somewhere in your nights, you're stuck when you think of me
Despite the life I lead
All this life in me
Spirits watch me pants down
Can't be 'barrassed of it
I feel their smiles on me (Smiles on me)
I feel their smiles on me (Smile on me)
I feel their smiles on me (Lens on me right now)
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
Throw team on back like I tatted the Mariah (Know I got some sins on me)
Then get the scream mask for the Vert rides (Ridin')
Weed smoke in the sky, picture what I'm realizin' (Got some sins on me)
Ain't seen rainbows in the sky since college
This thing won't last unless we're both lyin' (Both lyin', yeah)
Fake flowers, no water needed
Real life drowned by the weekend
No when's, call it timeless
No ends 'cause you're timeless (Timeless)
Despite our history (Yeah)
Somewhere in your nights, you're stuck when you think of me
Despite the life I lead
All this life in me (All this life)
Spirits watch me pants down
Can't be 'barrassed of it (Yeah)
I feel their smiles on me (On me, on me, on me)
I feel their smiles on me
I feel their smiles on me
Lionel got a lens, Janet got a lens
Matthew got a lens on me right now (Yeah)
Cleve got a lens, Kevin got a lens
Know I got some sins on me right now
On me
On me, on me
On me, on me
On me
On me, on me
On me, on me
On me, me

Marks on that freeway
Marks on that freeway
Alright, uh
If I was bein' honest
I'd say long as I could fuck three times a day and not skip a meal, I'm good
I used to work on my feet for seven dollars a hour
Call my mama like, "Mama
I ain't makin' minimum wage, mama
I'm on, mama, I'm on
Now I'm makin' 400, 600, 800K, mama
To stand on my feet, mama
Play these songs, it's therapy, mama
They payin' me, mama
I should be payin' them"
I should be payin' y'all, honest to God
I'm just a guy, I'm not a god
Sometimes I feel like I'm a god, but I'm not a god
If I was, I don't know which heaven would have me, mama
Let me run this bitch, I'ma run it into the ground, mama, the whole galaxy
Goddamn, fuck these lames, they don't want none
Fuck these lames, they don't want none
Fuck these niggas
Fuck these niggas, they don't want none
Fuck these niggas
Fuck you, nigga, and
Fuck me if I hated on you

Nigga, you got some just like me, don't you?
Or maybe not just like me
You know I'm Africano Americano
And even if you're half Japanese, roots run deep
Family tree throw a big shadow (Jammin' to the rhythm)
Tech company, please give me immortality (It's a face to face)
I'm goin' rapidly, fadin' drastically (Keep me high, castrati)
Damn (Punani fade the stress)
Or pull the zip down
Wet your lips first, lick the tip now (Bugatti left some stretch marks on that freeway)
Smoke somethin' (Marks on that freeway)
They tryna find 2Pac
Don't let 'em find 2Pac
He evade the press
He escape the stress
La, da-da-da
La, da-da-da
La, da-da-da
I'll keep quiet and let you run your phone bill up
I know you love to talk
I ain't on your schedule
I ain't on no schedule
I ain't had me a job since 2009
I ain't on no sales floor
You say I'm changin' on you, I feel like Selena
They wanna murder a nigga, murder me like Selena
You must ain't get the memo
I don't cuff bitches no more
But your bitch my exception
Come get her outta my four-door
I only got one four-door
Remember when I had that Lexus? No
Our friendship don't go back that far
Tyler slept on my sofa, yeah
Niggas go back that far
I ain't smoked all year
This the last song, so I'm finna wipe that off
Tolerance is so low, still smoke a whole 'gar
Ménage on my birthday, tap out on the first stroke
'Cause this ain't no work day, she don't give head anyway
'Cause what niggas say, that's what she tell her man
What a difference distance makes
Niggas wan' fight in the streets now, shit startin' to make my hands hurt
Jay hit me on the email, said I oughta act my net worth
Dog, this is chess now, not fetch, I ain't runnin' for a nigga
Ain't ran since track meets, that's the only time I ran from a nigga
You can change this track now, could've changed this bitch a long time ago
—know and —know, —know and —know
Shout out to Hollygrove, I'm from that 7th, though
Twins know and Lance know, Clark know and Matt know
Shit went one-eighty on me, please run that back, though (Tucks 'til twenty-four)
You say some shit about me? Tell the real story, my nigga (That shit happened a second time?)
('Cause Mark saw both times, nigga, I only saw the first time)
That second time, Jerron was there, nigga
On God, he grabbed me in circles, nigga
And the, and then the nigga tried to boom me— (Oh yeah, Jerron told me you that your ass, especially told me)
Yeah, 'cause the nigga tried to boom me in my face
I had AD in a headlock, nigga (The first time I saw?)
I had this nigga like—
Make sure you speak up
Okay
What's your name?
Ryan
Yo, ayy, be quiet
What's your name?
What do you do?
What's your first memory?
The first word I learned to say or that I ever said
What's the most amazing thing you've ever witnessed?
(Uh, hell no)
(You're not gon' make it, are you?)
Friendship and how it controls the world (Haha)
Haha
Alright, um
What three superpowers do you wish you had?
Ayy, my bad, say it again
Flying, contortion, to be invincible
Alright, make sure you speak up (What's your name?)
Maybe we can get a little bit, a little bit, little bit, little bit
I wish I could sleep without, like, being dead
But forever at the same time
Yo, what, what's, what's the year 3000 going to look like? (Dog, stop, stop—what you mean, bro? Stop, stop)
(It might look terrible, everything could be demolished, and the whole world could be over) Or it could be great and shit can fly
And buildings would be very, very tall and everybody won't know what the ground looks like
That's fucked up
(Excuse me)
Chloe, shh, okay, start over
Best thing about being me is
I got a nice set of friends, feel me?
A pretty clear mind, I feel like, sometimes
What's the worst thing about being me? Probably, uh–
Being Drake
I think a lot, a lot, too much
Sometimes I'm very musty
Talents, got any secret talents?
I don't think so, I'm pretty open with all, everything that I do
Secret talents? Um, I can play the theremin
Probably my brother, just to see how much work he has in one day
Probably, uh, probably Tyler, his life seems pretty awesome
No, actually, no, fuck him uh
I don't know
Probably Dill, 'cause he doesn't have to do anything at all
Just sits inside his house
What's your name?
Sage Elsesser
What do you do?
I play soccer
And I go to school
Um, I wanna be better at skating
Probably jump off something really high
Super high and try to land in like a handstand or something
Alright, that's it
I don't know, there would be a lot of things I'll do
Probably spend a lot of time with my family
Spend a couple hours with my family, and I would go out and do like everything that I ever thought about trying
I don't know, there's a lot of things that you could do
That's it
How far is a light-year? How far is a light-year?
(A second)
(I'd say like a thousand years?)

Stop! Stop! Stop!
Let me do it! (Fine)
No, you always play what you want to play! I want to play!
You don't got no Jodeci or something?
All you bitches want is Jodeci, what the fuck?
What is a Radiohead, anyway?
Whatever

Darker times (Oh my God, this is my song)
They're telling boulder-heavy lies (Don't play with me right now, what?)
Looks like all we've got is each other (Ah)
The truth is obsolete (Yes, I can listen to it)
Remember when all I had was my mother (Haha, let them sing)
She didn't compromise
She could recognize
Voodoo
Our daughters and our sons (See, all that is unnecessary)
Are just candles in the sun (Mmcht, huh, haha)
Voodoo
Don't let him see divide, hmm (I'm just playin', so tell me how I skate? What you mean?)
Don't you let her see divide (You said you could tell a lot about a man by the way he skates, so how do I skate?)
Voodoo (I don't know, just be real)
She's got the whole wide world in her juicy fruit (You, you're alright, heh)
He's got the whole wide world in his pants (There's somethin' about you, huh, I don't know)
He wrapped the whole wide world in a wedding band (I can't believe I'm even talking to you and telling you this right now)
Then put the whole wide world on her hands
She's got the whole wide world in her hands (You special, heh, I don't know about that)
He's got the whole wide world in his hands (I wish you could see what I see, hmm)
In his hands (*kiss*)
He wrapped the whole wide world in a wedding band
Then put the whole wide world on her hands
(She's got the whole wide world in her hands)
(He's got the whole wide world in his hands)
She peels an orange for us in the morning
She woke me up to give me half
I can hear the children soccer ballin'
Like wildcats running on the grass, hey
You're a girl on this island
I'm a boy from America
My flight leaves tonight
But I don't think I'm going backwards
I won't be going backwards
You're my golden girl
You're the one I've chosen, girl
You're 24K
You make it bright when it's grey
You're my golden girl
The sun has been kind to you
You're 24K (Girl)
But the sky's never grey (Never grey)
Silent moments, meditative poses
You break my focus, you make me laugh
Two mopeds racing through the forest
Making dirt clouds on a path, on a path
I'm my best on this island
I'm a mess in America
My flight left last night
But I know I'm not going back home, yeah
I'm not going back home, no
You're my golden girl
You're the one I've chosen, girl
You're 24K
You make it bright when it's grey
You're my golden girl
The sun has been kind to you
You're 24K (Girl)
But the sky's never grey (Never grey)
If we build a house in paradise, will we get to heaven still?
(Tropic, tropic, tropic, breezes, breezes, breezes)
If we don't have to live through hell just to get to heaven
(Tropic, tropic, tropic, breezes, breezes, breezes, breezes)
I'ma stay right here, with you
(Tropic, tropic, tropic, breezes, breezes, breezes, breezes)
'Til the hurricane comes, 'til the tsunami comes
(Tropic, tropic, tropic, breezes)
I've found my gold
You're my golden girl
You're the one I've chosen, girl
You're 24K
You make it bright when it's grey
You're my golden girl
The sun has been kind to you
You're 24K (Girl)
But the sky's never grey (Never grey)
Um, you're my G-O L-D E-N G-I R-L
And that's for the females that can't spell, but
Um, thanks for fuckin' with me
You turn my dark into light, you're like a bucket of bleach
You see, I want you to know that
My negatives at home aren't working for my Kodak
So that means that I don't want to go back
Just know that I would like to stay here and hold that
Hand of yours, girl, I'm a wreck in America
Your face is the best
'Cause it's the same color as the lace on my neck
And you're golden, uh, your eyes open, fuck it
Let's toast and listen to Michael Bolton
I free-fall off the hill again
Let's see where I land, I'm like Gilligan
Um, I trust you, Golden, for wed ring
I'm just hopin' that you don't turn my neck green

How come the ecstasy always depresses me so?
Chemically, I don't have no more new places to go
How come the ecstasy always depresses me so?
Chemically, I don't have no more new places to go
How come the ecstasy always depresses me so?
Chemically, I don't have no more new places to go

Chemically, I don't have no more new places to go

I got a question I wanna ask my momma
But she's been gone for some years now

But I gotta know for sure
So I'm gonna ask Lennon

On my lapel, at the table, I'm givin' a toast
The first wedding that I've been in my twenties
Thinkin' maybe someone is not somethin' to own
Maybe the government got nothin' to do with it
Thinkin' maybe the feeling just comes and it goes
Think I want me a lil' one that look like my clone

These bitches want Nikes
They looking for a check
Tell 'em it ain't likely
Said she need a ring like Carmelo
You must be on that white like Othello
All you want is Nikes, but the real ones
Just like you, just like me
I don't play, I don't make time
But if you need dick, I got you
And I yam from the line
Pour up for A$AP, R.I.P. Pimp C
R.I.P. Trayvon, that nigga look just like me
Woo, fuckin' buzzin', woo
That my little cousin, he got a little trade
His girl keep the scales, a little mermaid
We out by the pool, some little mermaids
Me and them gel like twigs with them bangs
Now that's a real mermaid
You been holding your breath, weighted down
Punk madre, punk papá
He don't care for me, but he cares for me
And that's good enough
We don't talk much or nothin'
But when we talkin' 'bout somethin'
We have good discussion
I met his friends last week
Feels like they're up to somethin'
That's good for us
We'll let you guys prophesy
We'll let you guys prophesy
We gon' see the future first
We'll let you guys prophesy
We gon' see the future first
Living so the last night feels like a past life
Speaking of the don't know what got into people
Devil be possessin' homies
Demons try to body-jump
Why you think I'm in this bitch wearing a fucking yarmulke?
Acid on me like the rain
Weed crumbles into glitter
Rain, glitter
We laid out on this wet floor
Away turf, no Astro'
Mesmerized how the strobes glow
Look at all the people feet dance
I know that your nigga came witcha
But he ain't witcha
We only human and it's humid in these Balmains
I mean, my balls stickin' to my jeans
We breathin' pheromones, Amber Rose
Sippin' pink-gold lemonades
Feelin'
I may be younger, but I'll look after you (Prophesy)
We're not in love, but I'll make love to you (Prophesy)
When you're not here, I'll save some for you
I'm not him, but I'll mean something to you
I'll mean something to you
I'll mean something to you
You got a roommate, he'll hear what we do
It's only awkward if you're fucking him too

Stop thinking of this as being money
"It's just money, I'ma make more"
No, no, no-no-no-no
Please decondition yourself
It's not just money, it's happiness
It's the difference between happy, being happy and sad
It's the difference between having a home and living on the streets
That's what it is, it's not just money
It's so much more than that
Right now, it's the difference between you being able to go to a prom and disappointing a girl
As I told you from the beginning, I don't have money
I have bills to pay, but that meant nothing to you, absolutely nothing
Hmm, let's see, I have
Ooh, yeah, I'ma make myself a hot link when I get home
Meant nothing to you
Saving my seven dollars

She singing, "Bitch, I'm paid, that's all I gotta say"
I'm like, who knew? Who knew? Who knew?
That after all the years, I'd make a Weezy fan
Out of you too, you too, you too
When I met you, you were Thom Yorke
Chris Martin and U2, U2, U2
When you met me, I was Three 6, Pimp C
Bun B, 8-Ball and MJG, yeah
But we're both a long way from home
We got the windows down, the radio's on, always
I wrote a letter to the sky
Saying, "Maybe one day you'll get to kiss me"
My girl found it in the car and said
"Baby, why you trying to diss me?"
'Cause you know you're my baby
Oh, you know you're my baby, ooh
I'm not just in it for the ride, in it for the ride
Yeah, oh, ah
Yeah, oh, ah
Yeah, oh
Yeah, oh
You said, "One day, I'll start up my car and it'll explode"
Well, now that's the last time I'm letting you watch Casino alone
You hate when I leave you in the motel while I hunt for jobs
So now I let you drive and wait outside in the parking lot
I know we're both a long way from home
Just keep the windows down, the radio's on, always
I wrote a letter to the sky
Saying, "Maybe one day you'll get to kiss me, kiss me, kiss me"
My girl found it in the car and said
"Baby, why you trying to diss me, diss me, diss me?"
Don't you know you're my baby?
Don't you know you're my baby, ooh?
I'm not just in it for the ride, in it for the ride, yeah
You'll live a better life
(A better life, young one, a better life, young one)
A dull life ain't nothing
Don't speed, who cares what car you're driving?
No Benz can make you friends
She don't care what car I'm driving
And no Bentley can kiss me back
This song is dedicated to my '91 Acura
My 1991

(Feel a certain way—)
'Cause you are beautiful and you are young
You deserve to have the best in life
(Feel a certain way—)

Yeah, yeah, oh (Woo)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
That's the way every day goes
Every time we've no control
If the sky is pink and white
If the ground is black and yellow
It's the same way you showed me
Nod my head, don't close my eyes
Halfway on a slow move
It's the same way you showed me
If you could fly, then you'd feel south
Up north's getting cold soon
The way it is, we're on land
So I'm someone to hold true
Keep you cool when it's still alive
Won't let you down when it's all ruin
Just the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above
Regard, my dear
It's all downhill from here
In the wake of a hurricane
Dark skin of a summer shade
Nosedive in the flood lines
Tall tower of milk crates
It's the same way you showed me
Cannonball off the porch side
Older kids trying off the roof
Just the same way you showed me (You showed)
If you could die and come back to life
Up for air from the swimming pool
You'd kneel down to the dry land
Kiss the earth that birthed you
Gave you tools just to stay alive
And make it out when the sun is ruined
That's the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love (Ah)
Glory from above
Regard, my dear (Ah)
It's all downhill from here
Remember life, remember how it was? (Ah)
Climb trees, Michael Jackson, all ends here (Recalling)
Say what up to Matthew, to Shoob (Ooh)
Say what up to Danny
Say what up to life, immortality (Ah, yeah)
Bending up my Nikes
Running out of the Melpomene, nicotine (Ah, yeah)
Stealing granny cigs (Take it easy)
Gimme something sweet
Bitch, I might like immortality (Woo)
This is life, life immortality

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Set the cheetahs on the loose
Oh, oh, oh, oh
There's a thief out on the move
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Underneath our legion's view
Oh, oh, oh, oh
They have taken Cleopatra
Run, run, run, come back for my glory (Cleopatra, Cleopatra)
Bring her back to me (Cleopatra, Cle-o-patra, Cleopatra)
Run, run, run, the crown of our pharaoh (Cleopatra, Cleopatra)
The throne of our queen is empty (Cle-o-patra, Cleopatra)
We'll run to the future, shining like diamonds
In a rocky world, rocky-ky world
Our skin like bronze and our hair like cashmere
As we march to the rhythm on the palace floor, ah-ooh
Chandeliers inside the pyramids tremble from the force
Cymbals crash inside the pyramids, voices fill up the halls
Oh, oh, oh, ooh
Set the cheetahs on the loose
Aye, ah, aye
There's a thief out on the move
Oh, oh, oh, ooh
Underneath our legion's view
Aye, ah, aye
They have taken Cleopatra, Cleopatra
The jewel of Africa, jewel
What good is a jewel that ain't still precious?
How could you run off on me? How could you run off on us?
You feel like God inside that gold
I found you laying down with Samson and his full head of hair
I found my black queen, Cleopatra, bad dreams, Cleopatra
Oh, oh, woah
Remove her, send the cheetahs to the tomb
Oh, oh, woah
Our war is over, our queen has met her doom
Oh, no more
She lives no more, a serpent's in her room
Oh, no more
He has killed Cleopatra, Cleopatra
Big sun coming strong through the motel blinds
Wake up to your girl
For now, let's call her Cleopatra, Cleopatra
I'll watch you fix your hair
Then put your panties on in the mirror, Cleopatra
Then your lipstick, Cleopatra
Then your six-inch heels, catch her
She's headed to the pyramid
She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid, ayy
Working at the pyramid tonight, oh yeah
Working at the pyramid, oh-ah
Working at the pyramid tonight, yeah
Working at the pyramid, oh
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Pimpin' in my convos
Bubbles in my champagne, let it be some jazz playing
Top floor motel suite, twisting my cigars
Floor model TV with the VCR
Got rubies in my damn chain
Whip ain't got no gas tank, but it still got woodgrain
Got your girl working for me
Hit the strip and my bill's paid, that keep my bills paid
Hit the strip and my bill's paid, keep a nigga bills paid
She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid, ayy
Working at the pyramid tonight, ayy
Working at the pyramid, oh-ah
Working at the pyramid tonight, yeah
Working at the pyramid, ooh
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
You showed up after work, I'm bathing your body
Touch you in places only I know
You're wet and you're warm just like our bathwater
Can we make love before you go?
The way you say my name makes me feel like I'm that nigga
But I'm still unemployed
You could say it's big, but you take it
Ride cowgirl
But your love ain't free no more, baby
But your love ain't free no more
She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid, ayy
Working at the pyramid tonight, oh yeah
Working at the pyramid, that's right
Working at the pyramid tonight, yeah
Working at the pyramid, ooh
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Air guitar
Oh, oh

U-N-I-T
U-N-I—Y
My head fatiguing off the opus
Kept it underground to focus
I feel afterlife, six-under oath, don't want no hocus-pocus
Niggas tryna go pop, I draw contact, rip my face mask
Nothin' but, nothin' but net, is you Roger or Novak?
You still are no match, you get no rematch
Boy, you missed your moment
Perusing the MoMA, I'm on all my lonely, burst in tears
On his shoulder and it's so cold 'cause he's sculpture
Where's the shaman? Ayahuasca
I had WhatsApp'd him for atonement
I never ever trust the pre-rolled
I never let a random motherfucker shoot the B-roll
I never ask advice from him 'cause what could he know?
Never fuck someone you wouldn't wanna be though
It forever seemed like time's up
When we swerved in the Honda
Now forever seems like no time
I mean, time flies when you have some
Both nuts weigh two pounds, all on your bitch like futons
My crew saved your crew, like
Niggas came through with the Groupons
Cookin' with the grease now, truffle fries and Cholula
Are you slowing down?
Are you holding down?
Whoever held you down?
Whoever propped you up, built the structures with you?
Swished the buckets with you, who was fuckin' with you?
Really brothers when you needed that?
When you see 'em now, is it forced black?
Hail Mary on the fourth down
Hands to the sky, yeah
Peace to the holy, peace to the people that think they know me
Piece of Moschino, cover your ass, your rectum showing
Peace to the boys that we used to be though
Geto Boy, North Face too cold on these hoes
Peace out to Willie D, Bushwick Billy, and 'Face
Piece of steak grillin' in Jesus' name, speakin' his grace
Hands to the sky
U-N-I-T-Y, Neptunes and peace signs
Chiraq, Palestine like
Iberville, 1995
You'd think that was airstrikes on outside
I put refugees in my villa, play kids the Fu-Gee-La
All this space Atlanta
Place order McMansion and two apple pies
I want the Porsche-uhh, Bugatti design
Silicon Valley, new venture is tits up
How do I crop your new bitch out my Vine?
Sick, blue nose pit foamin' white like frappo, jacko
El Chapo, de facto
Bell nacho, shell taco, crunch-crackle
Green emerald, pink diamonds like Apple Jack bowl

Oh, minha honey baby! Woo!

Mafia
My pillows ain't giving no comfort
And the fan is blowing way too loud
Even my heartbeat wakes me up
And I can't drown it out
Cause my eyelids ain't heavy enough
And there ain't enough sheep on my ceiling to count
Ain't slept a wink since you left me
No inspiration to dream, baby
You're my bedtime story
Bedtime but I can't sleep
No bedtime story, bedtime story, oh
I never really liked this apartment, no
There's not enough windows
That ain't the reason you left
I did that by myself
But I wish you'd come back before the sun comes up again
Cause my eyelids ain't heavy enough
And there ain't enough sheep on my ceiling to count
Ain't slept a wink since you left me
No inspiration to dream, baby
You're my bedtime story
Bedtime but I can't sleep
No bedtime story, bedtime story, oh
You gotta let me read just a page of you baby
You gotta help me sleep this ain't healthy, no way
Where's my bedtime story
Just three words to my bedtime story, bedtime story, oh
Every time I lay my head down
Baby I, baby I, baby I'm thinking of you
Baby I-I'm thinking of you
Every time I lay my head down
Baby I, baby I, baby I'm thinking of you
Baby I-I'm thinking of you
Ain't slept a wink since you left me
No inspiration to dream, baby
You're my bedtime story
Bedtime but I can't sleep
No bedtime story, bedtime story, oh
You gotta let me read just a page of you baby
You gotta help me sleep this ain't healthy, no way
Where's my bedtime story
Just three words to my bedtime story, bedtime story, oh
I love you, I love you

That ain't really loud
Couldn't raise his voice 'cause his wind gone (Woo)
Nigga sound like Reggie (Reggie)
(Already, they ran through already) Yeah
(Oh, niggas goin' in, fuck it)
Pray to the pipe (Fuck it), I slide deep inside
Not too deep, not too shallow, I'm mindful of size
She chock-full of my swipe, like a capsule sealed tight
With that substance you need, start a family tonight
Big-body Merc', LED lights, and it's all overpriced
The dollar been cheap than a bitch
Tuberose and tulips
On the boxes you're in, from the holes in your skin
Hit the road and get rich, or stay home and get broke
It's your choice in the end
Yeah, they watching my fence, like they next to my kin
Like they paid by the pope, got some priests by the door
Frisk the demons before they step into my glow
Oh my, my
Get it, get it!

That's a pretty big trunk on my Lincoln Town Car, ain't it?
Big enough to take these broken hearts and put 'em in it
Now I'm drivin' 'round on the boulevard, trunk bleedin'
And every time the cops pull me over, they don't ever see them
They never see them (Wow)
And I've got this black suit on
Roamin' around like I'm ready for a funeral
Five more miles 'til the road runs out
I'm about to drive in the ocean
I'ma try to swim from somethin' bigger than me
Kick off my shoes
And swim good, and swim good
Take off this suit
And swim good, and swim good, good
Don't, Don't die
Don't die, don't die
Don't, oh, no
Don't die, don't die
Got some pretty good beats on this 808s CD, yeah (Yeah)
Memory seats I'm sittin' on stay heated (Yeah)
I woulda put tints on my windows, but what's the difference?
If I feel like a Ghost (No Swayze)
Ever since I lost my baby
I've had this black suit on (Wow)
Roamin' around like I'm ready for a funeral (Wow)
One more mile 'til the road runs out, out
I'm about to drive in the ocean
I'ma try to swim from somethin' bigger than me
Kick off my shoes
And swim good, and swim good
Take off this suit
And swim good, and swim good, good
I'm goin' off (Oh, my pretty love)
Don't try stopping me
I'm goin' off (Throw me a line)
Don't try saving (You broke my heart)
No flares (You broke my heart)
No vest (You drove my love)
And no fear
Waves are washin' me out
I'm about to drive in the ocean (Drive in the ocean, yeah)
I'ma try to swim from somethin' bigger than me (Bigger than me)
Kick off my shoes (Good)
And swim good, and swim good (Good)
Take off this suit (Take off this suit, woah)
And swim good, and swim good, good (Yeah)
Don't, Don't die
Don't die, don't die
Don't, oh, no
Don't die, don't die
Don't, Don't die
Don't die, don't die
Don't, oh, no
Don't die, don't die

Are you against—
You against me, me?
Or are you with me?
Are you with me?
Are you with me?
Is it a deathwish to doze off helpless?
And leave myself at the mercy of you
At the mercy of you
And I'll be needing my sleep in peace
I need to trust you
At the mercy of you
Me, at the
At the (me), at the, of you
Me, at the
At the (me), at the, of you
Me, at the

City view turned to the mountain view
Find a place for a quiet one
Suburbia got a yard
All this estate for my mind to run
(Run, run, run)
I know you're in here somewhere
You came with someone
There's something you need
Someone out there
But try to love the one you're with tonight
Try to love the one you're with
Late at night, sometimes it helps
If you don't have to be all by yourself
In a moment, life could end
And this could all be over with
I know you're in here somewhere
You came out alone
Something you need
It's been so long
Gotta find the one
Who'll hold you tight
Feel what I'm sayin'? (Yeah)
Like ten, ten, twelve, eleven, ten, six, aight?
Platinum

Yup
Duplex in New Orleans East
I was writin' down everything
Things I would tell nobody
Some things I didn't even tell me
Sleepin' on my back, my body would wake up after me
My barber fresh out the penitentiary
That alcohol was stingin' me
My four cousins stayed with me, stayed with us
One was in the shower
My aunt-in-law come over to fuss and fight
So she get out in cutoffs and a wifebeater
Bare feet and bra-less, titties swingin'
She was seventeen then
Vaseline and Reebok Classic's
Weaves and baskets
Take the bully on the greenest grasses
His name was Renny, we was cool after
Matthew had some pairs of Air Max's
Clarky had them road rashes
Lost your virgin on a air mattress
Texturizer, feelin' unnatural
This what I would do just to show you that it's special now
What could I do to know you better than I do now?
What can I do to love you more than I do now?
What can I do to know you better?
What can I do to show my love?
What can I do to know you better?
What can I do? What can I do?

Saturdays involved making our entrances into life outside
We've been in this room too long
Recreation is keeping us self-contained and aware
Of each other's forms still and in full strides
Just the same
Keeping us warm
Walking in straight lines
Talking to sleep at night
Coddled and pacified
By versions of mothers
It's all new to me
It's all new to me
Having you around
It's all new to me
It's all new to me
Having you 'round the Higgs
What if we decide to live by choice?
All this time I knew
That average was something to fall back on after genius ends
I watch video
Only difference is flattened and remiss
Sparks of lightning storm behind wet faces
Slipped my pants back on and rewind it backward more
The tape stopped before I was back alone
I'll be back before
The street lights on, before the daylight's gone
I was spoiled by lavish thoughts
They don't compare, no, not at all
And had this been the past I might not know
What to do with all
Of what you showed
What you give, my words can't hold
And if acts of God breaks us apart
Least we did ours
Turn back, turn back
Turn back, turn
Back, turn back, turn
If you've never been in love

Arm stretch a tee like I nailed it
Raf movin' slow like a creep
Shirt in the breeze like I'm sailin'
And I walk in my sleep, I can't help that (I can't)
When's the last time I asked for some help that
I couldn't get from nobody else, yeah?
I couldn't get from nobody out there (I can't)
When's the last time I asked for some help that
I couldn't get from nobody else, yeah?
Nobody
I don't get weak in the knees
Hundreds spread out like a fan
Vert feel like some Gucci sandals
Open the sky, get a handful
Torso marked up like a vandal
How you not fuckin' with cash?
God gave you what you could handle
Gave you what you could handle
I got the grip like the handle
And I'm bikin'
I'm bikin' with me and my Daniel
Hades got the angels
TV's got the angles
I'm brakin' (Got—)
Bikin', I'm bikin', I'm bikin' slow-mo (Slow-mo)
Maybe the four wheel excitin' us mo' (Vroom)
I'm cold when the temperatures dip below 70s
How can I be burr around L.A. coast?
The diamonds is plural, the Tiffany brooch
On my lapel at the table, I'm givin' a toast
The first weddin' that I've been in my twenties
Thinkin' maybe someone is not somethin' to own
Maybe the government got nothin' to do with it
Thinkin' maybe the feeling just comes and it goes
Think I want me a lil' one that look like my clone
Me and my baby can't do on our own
I landed a trick, got my impossibles
I'm fuckin' with Addy, I'm watchin' my dose
24 hours like they never close
I'm bikin', I'm bikin', I'm bikin' these blocks, yeah
Since Ben Baller sold all his ice up at Slauson (Ooh)
I'm bikin' uphill and it's burnin' my quads (Obstacles)
I'm bikin' downhill and it sound like a fishin' rod
Savage, I'm bikin', yeah
Transition lightning (Ascending)
Ashes and remnants of ballers
Body that's gutted
A Bentley that used to be flawless
I'm high up, the raindrops keep falling
Scattered, the showers
Don't scaffold the towers
I'm up, mom, I promise
In class with the honors
No cheat like I'm honest
And how did I become so accomplished?
'Cause I don't see foes (Foes)
I just see a code (Code)
I just see a hole
Chinks in your armor
Like Pac in the Hummer
Like Jigga in summer
Left the house like Obama
Hit the road like a runner
Hit the road like Road Runner
I'm biking, I'm biking, I'm biking
I don't get weak in the knees
Hundreds spread out like a fan
Vert feel like some Gucci sandals
Open the sky, get a handful
Torso marked up like a vandal
How you not fuckin' with cash?
God gave you what you could handle
Gave you what you could handle
I got the grip like the handle
And I'm bikin'
I'm bikin' with me and my Daniel
Hades got the angels
TV's got the angles
I'm brakin'
Got, got me fucked up
Got a million-dollar bike
Got a million-dollar bike
Got, got me fucked up
Got me fucked up, up
Million-dollar bike
Got, got me fucked up, up
Million-dollar bike
Got, got me fucked up
Got a million-dollar bike
Got a million-dollar bike
Got, got me fucked up
Got me fucked up, up
Million-dollar bike
Got, got me fucked up, up
Million-dollar bike

The best song wasn't the single, but you weren't either
Livin' in Ladera Heights, the black Beverly Hills
Domesticated paradise, palm trees and pools
The water's blue, swallow the pill
Keepin' it surreal, whatever you like
Whatever feels good, whatever takes your mountain high
Keepin' it surreal, not sugar-free
My TV ain't HD, that's too real
Grape vine, mango, peaches, and lime
A sweet life, a sweet life, sweet life
Sweet life, sweet life
A sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet life
A sweet life, a sweet life, sweetie pie
You've had a landscaper and a housekeeper since you were born
The starshine always kept you warm
So why see the world, when you got the beach?
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach
The sweet life
The best song wasn't the single, but you couldn't turn your radio down
Satellite need a receiver, can't seem to turn the signal fully off
Transmittin' the waves
You're catchin' that breeze 'til you're dead in the grave
But you're keepin' it surreal, whatever you like
Whatever feels good, whatever takes your mountain high
Keepin' it surreal, not sugar-free
My TV ain't HD, that's too real
Grape vines, mango, peaches, and lime
A sweet life, a sweet life
A sweet life, yeah
A sweet life, a sweet life
A sweet life, live and die in the life
You've had a landscaper and a housekeeper since you were born (Yeah)
The starshine always kept you warm
So why see the world, when you got the beach?
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach
And the water is exactly what I wanted
It's everything I thought it'd be (Thought it'd be)
But this neighborhood is gettin' trippier every day
The neighborhood is goin' ape shit crazy, aah
You've had a landscaper and a housekeeper since you were born
The starshine always kept you warm
So why see the world, when you got the beach?
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach
The sweet life

Hand me a towel, I'm dirty dancing by myself
Gone off tabs of that acid, form me a circle, watch my Jagger
Might lose my jacket and hit a solo, one time
We too loud in public, them police turned down the function
Now we outside, and the timing's perfect
Forgot to tell you, gotta tell you how much I vibe with you
And we don't gotta be solo
Now stay away from highways
My eyes like them red lights
Right now, I prefer yellow
Redbone, so mellow
Fuck 'round, be cuttin' you
Think we were better off solo
I got that act right in the Windy City that night
No trees to blow through, but blow me and I owe you
Two grams when the sunrise
Smokin' good, rollin' solo
Solo (Solo)
Solo (Solo)
S-solo (Solo)
S-solo (Solo)
It's Hell on Earth, and the city's on fire
Inhale, in Hell, there's Heaven
There's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky
Inhale, in Hell, there's Heaven
Ah, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh-ooh, oh, oh
Solo (Ah)
Solo
Solo (Ah)
Solo
I'm skippin' showers and switchin' socks, sleepin' good and long
Bones feelin' dense as fuck, wish a nigga would cross
And catch a solo, on time
White leaf on my boxers, green leaf turn to vapors for the low
And that mean cheap, 'cause ain't shit free and I know it
Even love ain't, 'cause this nut cost, that clinic killed my soul
But you gotta hit the pussy raw though
Now your baby mama ain't so vicious
All she want is her picket fence
And you protest, and you picket sign
But them courts won't side with you
Won't let you fly solo, yeah
I wanted that act right in Colorado that night
I brought trees to blow through, but it's just me and no you
Stayed up 'til my phone died
Smokin' big, rollin' solo
It's Hell on Earth, and the city's on fire
Inhale, in Hell, there's Heaven
There's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky
Inhale, in Hell, there's Heaven (Ooh)
Ah, oh, oh, oh (Ah, oh, oh)
Oh, oh-ooh, oh, oh (Oh, oh)
Solo (Ah, ah)
Solo (Woo)
Solo (Woo, by myself)
Solo
Solo (Nah)
Solo (Ah, ooh)
Solo (Woo, nah, ah)
Solo

Here's to a good guy, he hooked it up
Said if I was in NY, I should look you up
I, first time I'd ever saw you
And you text nothing like you look
Here's to the gay bar you took me to
Here's when I realized you talk so much more than I do
I, here's to the highlights when I was convinced
That this was much more to you than some some-night shit
I know you don't need me right now
And to you, it's just a late night out
Bitches, nigga, all the bitches in the neighborhood wanna fuck you, nigga
(They told me)
I used to fuck with all of 'em
(Yeah, I ain't got bitches no more)
But now, I don't care about bitches like that, my nigga, that shit—
Jasmine fucking wrecked my heart, I don't even know how to feel about bi—

In the song, Frank’s a sucker for love. He’s loves this girl enough to marry her.
I told her that I missed her, put her on a plane
Goyard luggage is just a product of the fame
I told her that I dug her, I wasn't running game
And if she left a nigga, I wouldn't be the same
She met me at the W, grabbed me by my chain
Then kissed me like she meant it, so glad she came
Told me she was in love, she wasn't running game
And since she got off the plane, she didn't feel the same
I made a change for my baby, a difference for love
And I ain't frontin', feel like you were the one
That got the ring, girl, if you want
Could have my name, girl, if you want
See, baby, I've been lookin' so long
Feel like you let me try and wasn't feelin' them at all
'Cause, baby, I'm a sucker for love, a sucker for love
Girl, I'm a sucker for love, a sucker for love (Woah)
You've been sufferin' so long
You knew that it was over, wasn't feelin' them at all
'Cause, baby, you's a sucker for love, a sucker for love
A sucker for love, a sucker for love (Woah)
Summer lovein' in the winter, flamin' in the rain
The only one I'm into, never gonna change
'Cause when I said I dug her, I wasn't running game
Since she been rocking wit' me, the crush has been insane
She's a 1 of 1, D color VVS stone
My precious and my everything, no, please don't leave me 'lone
She told me she was so sprung, I never was a lame
And that the feelings so good, she wish that it would stay
I made a change for my baby, a difference for love (Forever)
And I ain't frontin', feel like you were the one
That got the ring, girl, if you want
Could have my name, girl, if you want
See, baby, I've been lookin' so long
Feel like you let me try and wasn't feelin' them at all
'Cause, baby, I'm a sucker for love, a sucker for love
Girl, I'm a sucker for love, a sucker for love (Woah)
You've been sufferin' so long
You knew that it was over, wasn't feelin' them at all
'Cause, baby, you's a sucker for love, a sucker for love
A sucker for love, a sucker for love (Woah)
Love, said I only think about her when I wake up
Oh, love, we did it for, we did it for love, love, love
See baby lookin' so long
Try and wasn't feelin' them at all
A sucker for love
A sucker for love
A sucker for love
A sucker for love
Been sufferin' too long
Over, wasn't feeling them at all
A sucker for love
A sucker for love
A sucker for love
A sucker for love
(Said I only think about her when I wake up)
(Ooh, love, we did it for, we did it for love, love, love)

Yeah
Oh-oh, yeah
I've been meaning to fuck you in the garden
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Been breathing so hard, we both could use the oxygen
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Just hop on my back, I'll take you down the stairs
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Into my backyard, then lay you right on the grass, eh
Give it to you over again, over again, over again
Over again
Making love
Underneath the cherry leaves
Baby girl
Tell me how my nature feels
Said, oh, baby (Oh, baby)
Up against the cherry tree (Ah, ah)
Baby girl (Baby girl)
I'll give it to you naturally
Naturally, oh-oh
Feeling like Adam when he first found out this existed
"Ha, wow..."
Me and my Eve trying out our first positions
Ha, yeah
And it's all good, and it's all free
And it's all you, and it's only me
Playing in the dirt wrestling myself inside you
Yeah (Ah-ah)
Give it you over again, over again, over again
Over again
Said, making love
Underneath the cherry leaves (Ah, ah, ah)
Baby girl
Tell me how my nature feels (Ah, ah)
Said oh, baby (Oh, baby)
Up against the cherry tree (Ah, ah)
Baby girl (Baby girl)
I'll give it to you naturally
My cavewoman
I'm a caveman
Doing wild things
In a wild land
We keep going, baby
We keep getting it, baby
We'll get pebbles, maybe
A couple bam-bams
Bam, bam
Bang, bang
Girl, your heart goes
Bam and bang
Feel my heart go, go, go...
Do what you feel now!
Electric feel now!
Do what you feel now!
Electric feel now!
Do what you—(*Cassette ejected*)

We once had things in common
Now, the only thing we share is the refrigerator
Ice cold, baby, I told you, I'm ice cold (Ice cold)
You out here flyin' high (High)
Huh, go 'head, fly that thing
High, high, yeah
But fly alone
You always smokin' in the house
What if my mother comes over?
You can't get up and get a job
'Cause this little hustle's gettin' you by
You're the dealer and the stoner
With the sweetest kiss I've ever known
I know what I was on
I had a Pilot Jones (What you know about her?)
She took me high (Oh, did she now?)
Then she took me home (We talkin' 'bout)
Pilot Jones, Pilot Jones
Tonight, she came stumblin' across my lawn again
I just don't know why I keep on tryna keep a grown woman sober
See, there you go reachin' up your blouse
And no, I don't want a child
But I ain't been touched in a while
By the dealer and the stoner
With the sweetest kiss I've ever known
I know what I was on (Ever known, we'll fly, fly)
I had a Pilot Jones (We'll fly, fly, fly, what you know about her?)
She took me high (We'll be here flyin', oh, did she now?)
Then she took me home (Oh, we talkin' 'bout)
Pilot Jones, Pilot Jones
In the sky up above, the birds
I saw the sky like I've never seen before, yeah
Thought I was above you
Above this in so many ways
But if I got a condo on a cloud
Then I guess you can stay at my place
Boo-hoo, I'ma get one
Mm-hmm, I need ya
I admit it, you're my Pilot Jones

My flag is American, but I love some Queen
I'm young enough to vote, and toke the trees
I'll be playing concerts in the mud, until the sequel
I'll be finding subjects to paint in the buff, behind the easel
Tryna fuck, I'm a bad boy
I'm a punk, I'm a black man, I could dunk
And I'm hanging low
And I'm swinging far
Home, home
What you say?
You need a hero
Heard 'em say
You need a save, hey
How high, tell me how high shall we jump?
How far, really how far have we come?
I've been wondering if we'd be better off without it
I was wondering, were we better off before?
Who needs you? Who needs you?
Who loves you? Who doesn't?
What you say?
You need a save, hey

Gotta rinse off out here
I can't see your diamonds
I need a week in paradise
I went god mode all year
I can't see so cloudy
Paradiso laundries
I keep the cheats on all year
Sometime in heaven
You still behind like ancestor
All on your mood board all year
I went god mode about it
You ain't got no muscles, lil' nigga
I ain't in the mood for it all year
I keep the cheats on always
Wrong side of average
Now when you slide on me, you slide on me
You slide off, oh, peace out, yeah, yeah
That's a free slide on me, first time's on me
Next time won't be, oh, yeah, yeah
For your mentality
You play ball, you run five-on-five, least three times a week
Glen Park, down the street
Waiting on you to tire, retire with victory
Play so savagely
Always fighting with them you grew up with
When you lose, you don't cry, but you low-key sad to see, uh-ah-uh
If we cut like some champions, you'll redeem yourself
You'll sleep happily, uh-ah-uh
Smilin', I'm still working while you dream, pop
I could never let a scene stop, smilin' on me
I don't think they get the point, pop
They forgettin' that it's me, akh
Akhi, tell 'em I ain't gone, wallahi
I'm just all day runnin' numbers
How the fuck you think I live?
Too many heads waiting for my downfall
They're like, "Something's gotta give"
Boys in the building give me updates like they know the weather
If you ain't in the streets, you can't see the sky, I'm out here
I could see the sky, and it's paradise
On the regular
And when you slide on me, you slide on me
You slide on, oh, slide, yeah, yeah
Now when you slide on me, you slide on me
First time on me, oh, yeah, yeah
This is for when you change your mind and slide back this way
This is for that night when setbacks won't let that much fade
Guess you can't blame the ones you choose
Blah, blah (Blur), blah (Blur)
Blah, blah, blah (Blur)
Blah, blah, blah (Blur)
Blah, blah, blah, blah

Love that I, love that I give
That is not love that I get from (Uh, uh-huh)
Love that I, love that I give (Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh)
Look at them shakes, oh yeah (That is not love)
Made up a dance (That I get from)
How come you shook
When I ain't took out my hands?
Beans, Starbucks, starstruck
Bitch comin' soon, yeah
That's 'cause you suck (Suck me, suck me, suck me)
That's comin' soon (Suck my dick, uh)
Come on, I'm back, I want my babe
Stayin' alert, I'm goin' steady
'Cause all my chains, diamonds keep callin'
Findin' the key, put it in, Kawasaki
Totin' that Amazon (Amazon)
Shit like 6'5" (Shit like 6'5")
Take back, rewind, now I rewind
Ooh, ooh, baby, be mine (Baby, be mine)
Ooh, ooh, baby, be mine
Just got a pack, came from the DHL, just got up with a pack
Got out a pack, came from the DHL, just got off like a bail
Got out a pack, new one's in my jail
Just got out, found a pack, I got a pack

Just got a pack, came from the DHL
We get the check, bail (Like it long-term like the pill)
I got a pack, came from the DHL
Just got up on a pill, I got a—
Niggas think it's new, it ain't new, boy
Old files just turned two, yeah, it flew, yeah
Still sound like it's comin' soon, comin' soon, yeah
Still sound like it's comin' soon, tell the truth, woah
Boy-toy suck me like a Hoover, like a Hoover
Boy-toy ride me like a Uber, like a Uber
Smiley face, factory case, ain't bust it down, yeah

Wavy pool, sit behind the pool

Remind me of trade, brushin' his waves
Shit look like ramen noodles
Fuck, this shit sound like it's comin' soon, comin' soon, bro
And it still sound like it's comin' soon, comin' soon
New files sittin' on my drive, nothin' new, yeah
New fobs and I can't get down, what to do? Yeah
New fobs, really can't get down to the pool, yeah
New glist' sittin' on a cyst on my wrist, yeah
New bitch ridin' on my dick like a kit, yeah
All of them days when I paid for the studio rate
Instead of the rent, yeah
Now I can hang in this bitch every day
Wait for some inspiration to hit me
Look like I'm dressed for a hike
But I really look like I'm in Paris and shit, yeah
Look like I'm dressed for a camp
'Cause I'm pitchin' a bag, like I'm pitchin' a tent, yeah
This ain't no fuckin' hopes and dreams, it's prophecy
Hardly sleep, faith was in the coffee bean
Roman numerals, niggas pourin' up Ivy Leagues, 4's
Double D's exposed, throw some beads
Fuckin' these hoes, leave, now my fuckin' flow's stole
Screw me slow, yes
Ooh, he TX, XTC rollin'
You seen my bag, it's swollen
Rimowa, I can't even fold it
I drop you a pin like I'm bowlin'
We moanin' 'til not even mornin'
Breakfast and dinners is blendin'
We spend all that time alone, alone
Watchin' the clouds roll, woah

Just got up with a pack
I got a pack, came from the DHL
Just got up with a pack

I got a pack, came up on DHL
Just came up with a pack
I got a pack, came up on DHL
Just caught up with a pack
I got a pack, came up on DHL
Just got off with the pack
Independent jug, sellin' records out the trunk
I'm already rich as fuck, so the product's in the front
Got my partner in the front, been my BF for a month
But we been fuckin' from the jump (Jump, jump, jump, jump)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I saw your eyes
Your eyes fall
You didn't wanna cry
So you kept your eyes closed
I could be great
I'm on my way
If I want escape
I can escape
I could be great
I'm on my way
If I want escape
I can escape, yeah
I could be great
I'm on my way
If I want escape
I can escape
I saw your eyes
I saw your eyes fall
You didn't wanna cry
So you kept your eyes closed
I could be great
I'm on my way
If I want escape
I can escape
I could be great
I'm on my way
If I want escape
I can escape
Coming down Fig
Turn left on Gage
I had an M5
Headlights were square like the Jakes
Race on a date
Race and sedate
I know you lie
You just don't lie to my face
I can't be great 'til…
I can escape
Coming down Fig
Turn left on Gage
Had an M5
When headlights were square like the Jakes
Race on a date
Race and sedate
I know you lie
You just don't lie to my face
I can be great—
What's that? (149)
Oh, it's fast (Yeah)
Cool, yeah
I saw your eyes
I saw your eyes fall
You didn't wanna cry
So you kept your eyes closed
I could be great
I'm on my way
If I want escape
I can escape
We was on a date
I took you to McKenzie's
That's like your favorite (Favorite)
I don't like fried chicken
I don't want no Chick-fil-A
And I know they rob niggas
Can't do that drive-thru today
Coming down Fig
Turn left on Gage
I had the M5 when the
Headlights were square like the Jakes
Race on a date
Race and sedate
I know you lie to me
You just don't lie to my face
I can't be great 'til I'm grateful for it
You just want hate, you got a gift for it
You don't wanna fight, you ain't built for that, huh
Yeah, roll call, you can see my hands
Jaws gon' break (Break)
Lip gon' bust, you like
"Why you snuck up on me
And ain't say nothing?"
I bit until my tongue gushed
I couldn't say I—
Huh, I ain't say nothing
I ain't say nothing
Get so paranoid
I ain't see nothing…
I used to play tough with the cops, had ideas
Told my girl who protest hold me a spot, and I'll go
Black folk know what talking white means, but still
Hold two open hands up in the sky, finger quotes
In my gangly youth, my limbs used to swing like Polo tees
Mazel tov, still pop a bottle like what Puff did Steve
If you can't tote your own weight, then what's this buff shit even 'bout?
Crystals in your lil' feet, that's all that dust protein
Swoop Tremaine from Calabasas in a Brit sports car
We used to cypher in Marc Jacobs, had the library card
At Scott's comparing the silver spoons to plastic knives and sporks
I was the dog, breathless, chasing the car up the street
If I ever catch it, I'll panic, that's the flaw in me
Nothing glamorous about growing up poor and naïve
Standing on the balls of my feet, trying to pray before I sleep
Selling like red light pussy
Gotta waterfall douche it
Level head on the cushion
Light pink, I'm revving
Light green, I'm someone like you, someone like me
Ring finger might sure get tooken
Wrist like springs, natural springs, water green indoor cookie
Other than me and you, ain't nobody else coming between, the glue stuck
We got the camera on Monday
We made a movie on Tuesday, fuck
We got the look, get looks
They never seen stars, the city too bright (Bright, bright)
I try to sleep, can't get a lot
Make dreams bleed into days
The pressure couldn't stop the bleeding
I started seeing things
Watching out for demons
Blocked him like a screen, these plays
I was always reading, yeah
Then some hair grew where the sun don't shine
And I started feeling like pussy popping was the paradigm
Getting my dick wet, maritime
Lying on my virgin, Jergens moisturized
Gee whiz, gee whiz, gee whiz
All my friends is so, "No homo"
Blaze to trail behind
No heroes in front of mind
Just rappers who'd evolve with time
Looked up to them, knew all the rhymes
But at that time, they enforced a bias
You know, like some cops stop and frisk a guy
'Cause he's brown, so of course he sides
With all the gangs these lames is extorted by
Switch lanes in the Porsche I drive
Let the police Ford Explorer by
Sirens screaming like they four or five
Throwing tantrums on the 405
Still on the whey like I'm tryna gain
Don't hibernate in the winter, that's where summer bodies are made
Just leg days like a sprinter
With the Bryan Baby blue interior
Big B's like GMO's
And they sting when my eyes close
All I see when my eyes close
Blame my emo on time zones
It's the same but different sets
Twin siblings, head spinning, exorcist
Selling like red light pussy
Gotta waterfall douche it
Level head on the cushion
Light pink, I'm revving
Light green, I'm someone like you, someone like me
Ring finger might sure get tooken
Wrist like springs, natural springs, water green indoor cookie
Other than me and you, ain't nobody else coming between, the glue stuck
We got the camera on Monday
We made a movie on Tuesday, fuck
We got the look, get looks
They never seen stars, the city too bright (Bright, bright)
Praying mantis
Fit by the Asians, wrist by Lorraine
Big Pharrell praying hands
Big P, Big P
Buss down face, two levitating hands
I wanna see the money in cash
So that I can truly grasp
Thanking the savior, God did a favor
Big Pharrell praying hands
Big P, Big P, Big P, Big P
Yeah, uh, Big P
Speaking of God, at ten years old, I switched church homes
Speaking of, speaking of God, speaking of God—
Yeah, yeah
No one to talk me off the ledge
Had to get in my own head
Had to get in my own head
You can go to the, uh, that
Whenever you feel like, uh…
Mmm, the first one, uh, the
Maybe keep it in four, though
Uh-huh
Speaking of God, at ten years old, I switched church homes
The bishop was tweaking, and we was Baptist
So how you a bishop? Like technically speaking
You drove a white Rolls, me and my family was type broke
The difference between having a home and not having a home was a tightrope
Visiting Catholic churches, the masses was quiet as mice, so the minister spoke with no microphone
They had no choir, so silent, I thought I heard Christ go, "You need a messiah"
Ran out the house from hormones, you seven months pregnant with Ryan
I figured I'd go to the East buy my T for some peace and quiet
I ended up running the streets with my cousins, sitting in the back
Listening to beats, scheming on schemes that came to pass
They strategy murder yourselves, don't fall according to stats
I pray the new plots clear and thick as bulletproof glass
'Cause the worst part of death is ambitions are dashed
Keep speaking death, it'll start to seem like the new car you wanna buy
It starts popping up on your way to work, see it all the time, always passing by
Call it playing Beetle-bug, yeah, it's on sight, better throw a punch
Running late to Teterboro, made the plane wait, because it's no rush
Clouds floating over oceans from above
Kinda looks like bubbles on a tub
Kinda like…

'Round your city, 'round the clock
Everybody needs you
No, you can't make everybody equal
Although you got beaucoup family
You don't even got nobody bein' honest with you
Breathe 'til I evaporated
My whole body see-through
Transportation, handmade (G)
And I know it better than most people
I don't trust 'em anyways
You can't break the law with them
Get some gushy, have a calm night
Shooters killin' left and right
Workin' through your worst night
If I get my money right
You know I won't need you
And I tell you (Bitch)
I hope the sack is full up
I'm fuckin', no, I'm fucked up
Spend it when I get that
I ain't tryna keep you
Can't keep up a conversation
Can't nobody reach you
Why your eyes well up? (Breathe)
Did you call me from a séance?
You are from my past life
Hope you're doin' well, bruh (Breathe)
I been out here head first
Always like the head first
Signal comin' in and out
Hope you're doin' well, bruh
Everybody needs you
Everybody needs you
Ooh, 'nani-'nani
This feel like a Quaalude
No sleep in my body
Ain't no bitch in my body (Ah)
New beginnings, ahh
New beginnings, wake up, akh
The sun's goin' down
Time to start your day, bruh
Can't keep bein' laid off
Know you need the money if you gon' survive
Every night shit, every day shit
Droppin' baby off at home before my night shift
You know I can't hear none of that "spend the night" shit
That kumbaya shit
Wanna see nirvana, but don't wanna die yet
Wanna feel that 'na-'na, though, could you come by?
Fuck wit' me after my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down and shit
Bummed out and shit, stressed out and shit
That's every day shit
Shut the fuck up, I don't want your conversation
Rollin' marijuana, that's a cheap vacation
My every day shit, every night shit
Every day shit (Every night shit, night shit, night shit, night shit)
All my night, been ready for you all my night
Been waitin' on you all my night
I'll buzz you in, just let me know when you're outside
All my night, you been missin' all my night
Still got some good nights memorized
And the look back's gettin' me right
Every night fucks every day up
Every day patches the night up (Night, come on)
On God, you should match it, it's that KO (That KO, God)
No white lighters 'til I fuck my twenty-eighth up (Fire)
1998, my family had that Acura (Fire)
Oh, the Legend (Fire)
Kept at least six discs in the changer (Yeah-yeah)
Back when Boswell and Percy had it active (Massive)
Couple bishops in the city buildin' mansions (Massive)
All the reverends (Massive, massive, ooh)
Preachin' self-made millionaire status (Yeah, yeah)
When we could only eat at Shoney's on occasion (Yeah, yeah)
After 'Trina hit, I had to transfer campus (Yeah, yeah)
Your apartment out in Houston's where I waited (Yeah, yeah, ooh)
Stayin' with you when I didn't have a address (Ooh)
Fuckin' on you when I didn't own a mattress (Fuckin')
Workin' on a way to make it outta Texas
Every night (Right now, right now, right now)
Droppin' baby off at home before my night shift, yeah
You know I can't hear none of that "spend the night" shit
That kumbaya shit
Want to see nirvana, but don't wanna die yet
Wanna feel that 'na-'na, though, could you come by?
Fuck wit' me after my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down
Bummed out, stressed out
That's just every day shit
Shut the fuck up, I don't want your conversation
Rollin' marijuana, that's a cheap vacation (Day shit)
Every day shit, every night shit (Every night shit, every day shit)
Every day shit, every day shit (Every night shit, every night shit)
Every day shit, every day shit (Every night shit, every night shit)
Every night shit

Tropical vibe, coconut milk and shaved ice
My soul glow with the low cut, no jheri curl, Jerry Rice
Boogie board on the rip tide
Parasail and deep dive, won't think twice
Your little baby bone boy killin' me
Swearing he's grown when he got that steel
But he ain't swam with that blue whale
I ain't swam with that ho neither, Earl said that world real
Sit back and watch the water, hope the monster don't wag his tail
And send that big wave over while I'm showin' off my pirate grill
To the baddies walkin' by me, showin' skin because it's nothing
My little brother servin' molly 'cause that bill due Monday
And my passport's buried and my home town flooded
With just a little bit of water, but my shoes still muddy
And if I ever have a daughter, I wonder what I could call her?
Nine months after I fuck on the beach, I guess I call her Karma
Copped a jet ski with the booster seat, I'm kiddin' but I'm ballin'
Just playin' but I'm serious, I'm witted and I'm wildin'
This life goes on, man, that's one thing about it
This life goes on, dawg, that's one thing about it
I'm feelin' what you're sayin', you're tryin' to get around it
But life goes on, pimpin', the wise don't doubt it
Stuck in the sky, first time upside down on the whole ride
And I wasn't much into the type that my bros like
So I never really had no wife and that's alright
"Black woman ain't got no man," that's what she said to me
Yeah she did, that you can date outside your race, I mean
I ain't supposed to show my love
Judge gotta like my case, I mean
Somebody please switch my plates, ship my car to Rome
5k on the wheels, still ain't ridin' chrome
Backpack rapper skills, veteran nigga deal
So let irrelevant nigga do what irrelevant nigga feel
Let a regular nigga judge
Because his gavel fake and he regular, still
How that gravel taste? How you paid your medical bill?
Sands white on my tan feet, Colosseum in the back seat
Straw hut where the beach be
Like screen saver when your Mac sleep
Relaxing, I ain't racin' no fuckin' rats, I'm relaxing
And if it's wrong to ya
Well, life goes on, brother, that's one thing about it
Life goes on, my nigga, one thing about it
I'm sayin' what you're seein', we tryin' to talk around it
But life goes on, pimpin', the wise don't doubt it



Poolside convo about your summer last night (Ooh, yeah)
About your summer last night
Ain't give you no play, mm
Could I make you shive last night?
Could I make you shy on the last night? (Last night)
Could we make it in? Do we have time?
I'll be the boyfriend in your wet dreams tonight
Noses on a rail, little virgin wears the white
You cut your hair, but you used to live a blonded life
Wish I was there, wish we'd grown up on the same advice
And our time was right
Keep a place for me, for me
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing
It's nothing, it's nothing
Keep a place for me, for me
Now and then, you miss it, sounds make you cry
Some nights, you dance with tears in your eyes
I came to visit, 'cause you see me like a UFO
That's like never, 'cause I made you use your self-control
And you made me lose my self-control, my self-control
Keep a place for me, for me
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing
Keep a place for me
It's nothing, it's nothing
It's nothing, it's nothing
Sometimes, you'll miss it
And the sound will make you cry
And some nights, you're dancing
With tears in your eyes
I, I, I know you gotta leave, leave, leave
Take down some summertime
Give up, just tonight, 'night, 'night
I, I, I know you got someone comin'
You're spittin' game, know you got it
I, I, I know you gotta leave, leave, leave
Take down some summertime
Give up, just tonight, 'night, 'night
I, I, I know you got someone comin'
You're spittin' game, know you got it (Yeah)
I, I, I know you gotta leave, leave, leave
Take down some summertime
Give up, just tonight, 'night, 'night
I, I, I know you got someone comin'
You're spittin' game, know you got it

I thought that things like this get better with time
But I still need you, why is that?
You're the only image in my mind
So I still see you, around
I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away
Said I miss you, missing you insane
If I got with you, would it feel the same
Words don't ever seem to come out right
But I still mean them, why is that?
It hurts my pride to tell you how I feel
But I still need to, now why is that?
Oh it's cause I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away
I said I miss you, I miss you insane
But if I got with you, would it feel the same
And it don't matter who you are
It is so simple, a feeling
But it's everything
No matter who you love
It is so simple, a feeling
But it's everything

Oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah (Yeah-yeah, yeah)
Oh-oh, oh (Yeah-yeah, yeah)
Ah-ah, ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah (Ha)
When we were kids
We handpainted strawberries on a swing
Every moment was so precious
Then
I'm still kicking
I'm daydreaming on a strawberry swing
The entire Earth is fighting
All the world is at its end
Just in case an atom bomb
Comes falling on my lawn
I should say, and you should hear
I've loved, I've loved the good times here
I've loved our good times here
Say hello, then say farewell
To the places you know
We are all mortals, aren't we?
Any moment this could go
Cry, cry, cry, oh
Even though that won't change a thing
But you should know, you should hear
That I have loved, I have loved the good times here
And I will miss our good times here
Spaceships are lifting off
Of a dying world
And millions are left behind
While the sky burns
There wasn't room for you and I
Only you, goodbye
Goodbye
Ah, now the sky could be blue, I don't mind
Without you, it's a waste of time
Could be blue, I don’t mind
Without you, it's a waste of time
The sky could be blue, could be grey
Without you, I'm just miles away
The sky could be blue, I don't mind
Without you, it's a waste of time
(*alarm clock*)

Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
I think I started something
I got what I wanted, did-didn't I?
Can't feel nothing, superhuman
Even when I'm fucking, Viagra popping
Every single record, autotuning
Zero emotion, muted emotion
Pitch corrected, computed emotion, uh-huh
I blame it on the model broad with the Hollywood smile, ow
Stripper booty and a rack like wow
Brain like Berkeley
Met her at Coachella
I went to see Jigga, she went to see Z-Trip, perfect
I took a seat on the ice-cold lawn
She handed me a ice-blue bong, whatever
She said she wanna be a dentist really badly
She's in school paying
For tuition, doing porn in the Valley
At least you working
But, girl, I can't feel my face
What are we smoking, anyway?
She said, "Don't let the high go to waste"
But can you taste, a little taste of…
Novocaine, baby, baby
Novocaine, baby, I want you
Fuck me good, fuck me long, fuck me numb
Love me now, when I'm gone, love me none
Love me none, love me none
Numb, numb, numb, numb
Sink full of dishes, pacing in the kitchen
Cocaine for breakfast, yikes
Bed full of women, flip on a tripod
Little red light on shootin'
I'm feelin' like Stanley Kubrick
This is some visionary shit
Been tryna film pleasure with my eyes wide shut
But it keeps on moving
I blame it on the model broad with the Hollywood smile
Stripper booty with a rack like wow, how-how
I'll never forget ya
You put me on a feeling I never had
Never had, never had (Never)
And ever since, I've been tryna get it back
And pick it up and put it back
Now I'm something like the chemist on campus
But there's no drug around
Quite like what I found in you, you
I still can't feel my face
What am I smoking, anyway? (Ahh)
She said, "Don't let the high go to waste" (Ooh)
But can you taste, a little taste of…
Novocaine, baby, baby (Ohh)
Novocaine, baby, I want you
Fuck me good, fuck me long, fuck me numb
Love me now, when I'm gone, love me none
Love me none, love me none
Numb, numb, numb, numb
Novocaine, Novocaine, Novocaine
Novocaine, Novocaine (Ohh)
Numb the pain, numb the pain, numb the pain
Numb the pain, numb the pain (Ohh, ohh)
Novocaine, Novocaine, Novocaine (Ohh)
Novocaine, Novocaine (Ooh)
For the pain, for the pain (Ohh, ooh-huh)
Novocaine, Novocaine
Ooh-huh, ooh-huh, ooh-huh
Ooh-huh, ooh-huh-huh-huh-huh
Ooh-huh, ooh-huh, ooh-huh
Ooh-huh, ooh-huh-huh-huh-huh
Pretty girls involved with me
Making pretty love to me, pretty
Pity, pity
All the pretty girls involved with me
Making pretty love to me, pretty
Pity, pity (Ooh)
I can't feel a thing, I can't feel, can't feel a thing
I can't feel a thing, can't feel, feel, feel, feel her
I can't feel, feel her
Novocaine, Novocaine, Novocaine
I can't feel, feel her
Novocaine for the pain, for the pain
I can't, can't feel her
Feel her, feel her, ohh
Novocaine, Novocaine, 'caine

“Dust” appears on the nostalgia, ULTRA mixtape.
Who's that talking in the library?
Who's that talking in my library? Is that you?
No, I won't put you out
'Cause what would this place be without my muse?
Nothing special
Every book in here, I wrote
Some I'm not too proud of, some I wish I could burn
So many pages I wrote
Wish I could revise them, but there's no erasing
And the best advice I got was keep writing, yeah
And keep living, yeah
And keep loving
Oh, loving and living and loving
And when the ink dries
And the pages turn to dust, so will we
Turn to dust, so will we
Dust, dust
Who's that laughing in my library?
Who's that laughing in my library? Is that you?
No, I won't put you out
'Cause what would this place be without your smile?
Nothing special
I fell in love with you, girl, oh-ooh
You let yourself inside, with no respect for privacy
You said, "There's too much on my mind"
Then you ripped out a page
And set that shit on flame, I quit writing
Oh-ooh, I kept living, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, ugh
I kept loving, ah, ah
And when the ink dries
And the pages turn to dust, so will we
Turn to dust, so will we
Dust, dust

I'll be honest, I wasn't devastated
But you could've held my hand through this, baby
Let my mind run underneath warm jets
I run my hands through what's left
But we're gettin' older, baby
Don't have much longer, baby
Why am I preachin' to this choir, to this atheist?
Just like mine, versions of these belong to you
After a while, they're keeping me close to you
Just like me, they long to be close to you

Many college students have gone to college and gotten hooked on drugs, marijuana, and alcohol
Listen, stop trying to be somebody else
Don't try to be someone else
Be yourself and know that that's good enough
Don't try to be someone else
Don't try to be like someone else, don't try to act like someone else
Be yourself, be secure with yourself
Rely and trust upon your own decisions
On your own beliefs
You understand the things that I've taught you
Not to drink alcohol, not to use drugs
Don't use that cocaine or marijuana, because that stuff is highly addictive
When people become weed-heads
They become sluggish, lazy, stupid, and unconcerned
Sluggish, lazy, stupid, and unconcerned
That's all marijuana does to you, okay? This is mom
Unless you're taking it under doctor's, um, control
Then it's regulated
Do not smoke marijuana, do not consume alcohol
Do not get in the car with someone who is inebriated
This is mom, call me, bye



A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain in
Southern California, much like Arizona
My eyes don't shed tears, but, boy, they pour when
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, ooh, no, no, no
I've been thinkin' 'bout you, you know, know, know
I've been thinkin' 'bout you, do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever, ooh
No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho
Since you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute
That's why I kissed you
Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it though
I'm lying down
Thinkin' 'bout you, ooh, no, no, no
I've been thinkin' 'bout you, you know, know, know
I've been thinkin' 'bout you, do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever, ooh
Yes, of course, I remember, how could I forget (How could I forget)
How you feel? (How you feel?)
You know you were my first time, a new feel
It won't ever get old, not in my soul, not in my spirit, keep it alive
We'll go down this road 'til it turns from color to black and white
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever, ooh

Turn a lamp on
Let me talk to you
See that light bulb, does something to you
Makes it a little harder to tell a lie don't it?
Make it difficult to run and hide don't it?
Tell the truth to me, good truth to me
Come close to me if that's you
I wanna see the details inside those beautiful eyes
The lies
Myself ain't never talked to me like that before (No)
I wonder what on earth he's searching for
No wonder why there's no mirrors on these walls no more
You can't tell me why you're so terrified of beautiful
Scared of the good more than the evil
Scared of the light more than the dark
Scared of the truth so much more than the lie
I'm scared for you
I'm scared of you
Scared of beautiful
Just turn the lamp down
Don't talk to me
That light bulb, took something from me
Or gave something to me
I can't decide, I can't decide
Took freedom, gave purpose
Can't blend in, too perfect
All this beauty ever gave me was a reason for some beautiful lies
Myself ain't never talked to me like that before (No)
I wonder what on earth he's searching for
No wonder why there's no mirrors on these walls no more
You can't tell me why you're so terrified of beautiful
Scared of the good more than the evil
Scared of the light more than the dark
Scared of the truth so much more than the lie
I'm scared for you
I'm scared of you
Scared of beautiful
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who is the fairest of them all
Mirror, mirror oh you're so unfair to all of the beautiful ones
No wonder why there's no mirrors on these walls no more
You can't tell me why you're so terrified of beautiful
Scared of the good more than the evil
Scared of the light more than the dark
Scared of the truth so much more than the lie
I'm scared for you
I'm scared of you
Scared of beautiful

Darker times
They're telling boulder-heavy lies
Looks like all we've got is each other
The truth is obsolete
Remember when all I had was my mother
She didn't compromise
She could recognize
Voodoo
Our daughters and our sons
Are just candles in the sun
Voodoo
Don't let him see divide, hmm
Don't you let her see divide
Voodoo
She's got the whole wide world in her juicy fruit
He's got the whole wide world in his pants
He wrapped the whole wide world in a wedding band
Then put the whole wide world on her hands
She's got the whole wide world in her hands
He's got the whole wide world in his hands, in his hands

No, I was just telling that I, I got this, this girl before
And I was together since three years
And uh, I was not even cheating her or what
And Facebook arrived and, uh
She wanted me to accept her on Facebook
And I don't want it, because I was, like, in front of her
In front of her, and she told me, like, "Accept me on Facebook"
It was virtual, means no sense
So I say, "I'm in front of you, I don't need to accept you on Facebook"
She starting to be crazy
She thought that because I didn't accept her, she thought I was cheating
She told me like, uh, "It's, it's over, I can't believe you"
I said, "Come on, you're crazy," because like, yeah
"I'm in front of you, I'm every day, here in your house"
That's, it means, like, it's jealousy, pure jealousy
For nothing, you know?
Virtual thing

And the peaches and the mangos that you could sell for me
What do you think my brain is made for?
Is it just a container for the mind?
This great grey matter
Sensei replied, "What is your woman?
Is she just a container for the child?"
That soft pink matter
Cotton candy, Majin Buu, ooh, ooh, ooh
Close my eyes and fall into you, you, you
My God, she's giving me pleasure
Oh, no, no
What if the sky and the stars are for show?
And the aliens are watching live
From the purple matter?
Sensei went quiet, then violent
And we sparred until we both grew tired
Nothin' mattered
Cotton candy, Majin Buu, oh, oh, oh
Dim the lights and fall into you, you, you
My God, giving me pleasure
Pleasure, pleasure, pleasure
Pleasure over matter
Hey, hey
Since you been gone, I been having withdrawals
You were such a habit to call
I ain't myself at all, had to tell myself, "Nah
She better with some fella with a regular job"
I didn't wanna get her involved
By dinner, Mr. Benjamin was sittin' in awe
Hopped into my car, drove far
Far's too close, and I remember my memory's no sharp
Butter knife, what a life, anyway
I'm building y'all a clock, stop, what am I, Hemingway?
She had the kind of body that would probably intimidate
Any of 'em that were un-southern, not me, cousin
If models are made for modelin'
Thick girls are made for cuddlin'
Switch worlds and we can huddle then
Who needs another friend? I need to hold your hand
You'd need no other man, we'd flee to other lands
Grey matter
Blue used to be my favorite color
Now I ain't got no choice
Blue matter
You're good at being bad (Ooh, yeah)
You're bad at being good (Ah-ha, oh)
For heaven's sakes, go to hell (Ah-ha)
Knock, knock on wood, hey (Ah-ha-ah)
You're good at being bad (You're bad at being good)
You're bad at being good (For heaven's sakes, go to hell, knock on wood)
For heaven's sakes, go to hell (Would have ya)
Knock, knock, knock, knock on wood
Well, frankly, when that ocean so mu'fuckin' good
Make her swab the mu'fuckin' wood
Make her walk the mu'fucking plank
Make her rob a mu'fucking bank
With no mask on and a rusty revolver

There will be tears, I've no doubt
There may be smiles but a few
And when the tears have run out
We'll be numb and blue, blue
I can't be there with you, but I can dream
I can't be there with you, but I can dream
I can't be there with you, but I can dream
I can't be there with you, but I can dream
I can't be there with you, but I can dream
I can't be there with you, but I can dream
I still dream, dream, dream
I still dream, dream (There will be)
My grandaddy was a player
Pretty boy in a pair of gators
See, I met him later on
Think it was 1991
The only dad I'd ever know
But pretty soon, he'd be gone too
Hide my face, hide my face
Can't let 'em see me crying
'Cause these boys didn't have no fathers neither
And they weren't crying
My friend said it wasn't so bad
You can't miss what you ain't had
Well, I can
I'm sad and
There will be tears, I have no doubt
There may be smiles but a few
And when those tears have run out
You will be numb and blue
"I can't be there"
That's all you had to say to me was you couldn't be there
Why couldn't you say to me you won't be there?
You coulda warned me you wouldn't be here
Right here, you wouldn't be here for me
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Taxi driver
Be my shrink for the hour
Leave the meter runnin'
It's rush hour
So take the streets if you wanna
Just outrun the demons, could you?
He said, "Allahu akbar"
I told him, "Don't curse me"
"Bobo, you need prayer"
I guess it couldn't hurt me
If it brings me to my knees
It's a bad religion
Ooh-hoo, this unrequited love
To me, it's nothin' but a one-man cult
And cyanide in my styrofoam cup
I can never make him love me
Never make him love me
Love me, love me
Love me, love me (Ooh-hoo)
Love me, love me (Ooh-hoo)
Love me, love me (Ooh-hoo)
Love me, love
Taxi driver
I swear, I've got three lives
Balanced on my head like steak knives
I can't tell you the truth about my disguise
I can't trust no one
And you say, "Allahu akbar"
I told him, "Don't curse me"
"Bobo, you need prayer"
I guess it couldn't hurt me, yeah
If it brings me to my knees
It's a bad religion
Ah-oh, unrequited love
To me, it's nothin' but a one-man cult
And cyanide in my styrofoam cup
I can never make him love me
Never make him love me
No, no, ah
It's a, it's a bad religion
To be in love with someone who could never love you
Oh-oh-oh, only bad, only bad religion
Could have me feeling the way I do

You don't know how little you matter until you're all alone
In the middle of Arkansas with a little rock left in that glass dick
Used to date a blonde, you used to hit it raw
'Cause she was and you are madly involved, madly involved
Hittin' stones in glass homes
You're smokin' stones in abandoned homes
You hit them stones and broke your home
Crack rock, crack rock
Crack rock, crack rock
Hittin' stones in glass homes
You're smokin' stones in abandoned homes
You hit them stones and broke your home (Ooh, ah, ooh)
Crack rock, crack rock
Crack rock, crack rock
You're shuckin' and jivin', stealin' and robbin'
To get the fixing that you're itching for
Your family stopped inviting you to things
Won't let you hold their infant
You used to get a little cut-up from time to time
But the freaks ain't trying to sleep with cracky
Hittin' stones in glass homes
You're smokin' stones in abandoned homes
You hit them stones, and you broke your home
Crack rock
Crack rock, crack rock
Crooked cop, dead cop
How much dope can you push to me?
Crooked cop, dead cop
No good for community
Fuckin' pig get shot, three hundred men will search for me
My brother get popped, and don't no one hear the sound
Don't no one hear the rounds (Ooh, sound)
Don't no one hear the shells (Ooh, shells)
Don't no one hear a sound
Don't no one disturb the peace for riot
Don't no one disrupt nirvana
Don't no one wanna blow the high
Crack rock (Ooh)
Crack rock (Ooh)
Crack rock
How you feeling, girl? (Ooh)
How's the gutter doing?
Crack rock

Haha, when I was younger
I used to wonder, like…
If I was singing songs just to sing the songs
Or if I was singing 'cause that's what the bitches wanted
I couldn't play guitar like Van Halen
Had no secret chords like Saint David
But you still came around, ate your lunch with me
Used to park your car to try the bus with me
But I would say, "Girl, don't be dumb—
I'm riding shotgun"
We could go to my house after school
After school, after school
'Cause my dad don't clock off 'til late
Off 'til late, off 'til late
We could kick it in the living room
Looking through my whole vinyl collection
And you could teach me how to slow dance or something
And I'ma give you chills, harmonizing to Otis, Isley, Marvin
And every time somebody ask me
If I sing songs to get at women
I say, "Yeah," they say, "No fair, no fair, it's cheating"
I say, "Shit, oh well, oh well," ha
And every time a nigga ask me
If I sing songs to get at women
I say, "Yeah," they say, "No fair, no fair, it's cheating"
I say, "Boy, don't judge, 'cause, hell, if you were me…"
You'd be singin' to her
Like, "La-da, da-da-da
La-da, da-da-da
La-da, da-da-da"
Now I'm in the lab, always working late
Always sleeping past the breakfast she makes
She used to stop by, come and holler at me
Put her purse down, and try to battle-rap me
She don't do that no more
No more, no more
Don't even listen to the songs I record
But she be banging that Drake in my car
I'm so far gone
She stay blasting Trey and his songs
All damn day long
It's like she never heard of me, heard of me
Now, every time somebody ask me
If I sing songs to get my women
I say, "Nah," they say, "Okay, I don't believe it"
I say, "Nope, I swear, I never do it"
And every time a nigga ask me
If I sing songs to get at women
I say, "Nah," they say, "Who do you think you kidding?
I know you, you stole my girlfriend"
Ah, ah (Ooh, ooh, ah)
Ooh, ah, yeah
Fair enough
You see, I just don't play fair
But it's fair enough
'Cause your girl broke my heart in half, uh-ah
I'm singing, "La-da, da-da," 'bout heartbreak
And now, I'm singing, "La-da, da-da," 'bout love lost
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Damn, haha
I'm saying though, like…
All I write is love songs
And I try
I come to the studio
I—you know what I do
What you think I do it for? Huh?
Yeah, uh-huh
But you ain't listening, never
But if you were…
You might fuck wit' it
Haha, yeah
All these songs for women
Songs for women
Songs for you, baby
For you



Yeah, crazy
I plead insanity
Crazy for you, baby
Crazy, na-na, yeah
Talk to me
And I better not hear a word
Oh, do me, baby
Ooh, I better not feel it, girl
Baby, I, I still got one bullet left
In my nine
Finna do a love crime, love crime
Finna do a love crime
Murder, murder, murder she wrote
Love crimes, love crimes
Murder, murder, murder she wrote
Love crimes, love crimes
You write me love letters
With your father's pen, oh
If he knew the freaky, freaky things
That you write with it, oh man
Is it really wrong that I want
To be the baby daddy?
Is that a love crime, love crime?
Tell me it's a love crime
Eh, murder, murder, murder she wrote
Love crimes, love crimes
Murder, murder, murder she wrote
Love crimes, love crimes
Oh, yeah, yeah
Murder, murder, murder she wrote
Love crimes, love crimes
Oh, yeah
In the getaway car
You know I love it when the ride is smooth
If we ever get caught
It'd be a long vacation for two
Murder, murder, murder she wrote
Love crimes, love crimes
Murder, murder, murder she wrote
Love crimes, love crimes
Murder, murder, murder she wrote
Love crimes, love crimes
Murder, murder, murder she wrote
Love crimes, love crimes
Millions of years of evolution, right? Right!? Men have to stick it in every place they can, but for women, women, it is just about security, and commitment, and—ah, whatever the fuck else! If you men only knew… but you're not the jealous type, are you? You've never been jealous about me, have you? And why haven't you ever been jealous about me!? You are very, very sure of yourself, aren't you?

Go, go, go
Forbidden from the beginnin', I saw her there, up there
Been like that since I met her, they said I couldn't have her
Way out of my league, I never believed it
Gotta get her heart, I gotta make her mine
But what if she just tells me I'm not quite her speed or
Shows me her bare hands and crushes my ego?
Dismiss me as a kid, tells me I'm barely legal
But barely legal is legal
You ain't gone get in trouble
Messin' with someone a little younger, younger
You ain't gone get in trouble
For messin' with someone a little younger
Who loves ya
Girl, if I gotta show ID (Show I-, show ID)
Then I'm gonna (Gonna)
Won't let you get in trouble
For messin' with someone a little younger
Younger, no
This conversation is taking us for a loop
But taking you serious is difficult to do
'Cause I don't believe ya
When you say that you don't
Ever look at me quite that way (That way)
You say that you tryin' to settle down
But you think I'm handsome
I should be having fun
I shouldn't move fast
So, let's go slower, not faster
'Cause it ain't no fun
Without ya
You ain't gone get in trouble
Messin' with someone a little younger, younger
You ain't gone get in trouble
For messin' with someone a little younger
Who loves ya
Girl, if I gotta show ID (Show I-, show ID)
Then I'm gonna (Gonna)
Won't let you get in trouble
For messin' with someone a little younger
Younger, no

Really, though, I think—
Fertilizer
I'll take bullshit if that's all you got
Some fertilizer
Fertilizer

The markings on your surface
Your speckled face
Flawed crystals hang from your ears
I couldn't gauge your fears
I can't relate to my peers
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather chip my pride than lose my mind out here
Maybe I'm a fool
Maybe I should move and settle
Two kids and a swimming pool
I'm not brave (Brave)
I'm not brave
I'm living over city
And taking in the homeless sometimes, I've
Been living in an idea
An idea from another man's mind
Maybe I'm a fool
To settle for a place with some nice views (Nice views)
Maybe I should move, settle down
Two kids and a swimming pool
I'm not brave
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather go to jail
I've tried hell (It's a loop)
What would you recommend I do? (And the other side of the loop is a loop)
This, this fe—, this feel, this feel, this feels
This feels how molly must feel
This feels how molly must feel
How molly must feel
This feels how molly must feel
How molly must feel
This is not my life
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
This is not my life
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
It's not what I'm like
It's just a fond farewell (Brave)
Speaking of Nirvana, it was there
Rare as the feathers on my dash from a phoenix
There with my crooked teeth and companion sleeping, yeah
Dreaming a thought that could dream about a thought
That could think of the dreamer that thought
That could think of dreaming and getting a glimmer of God
I be dreaming of dreaming a thought
That could dream about a thought
That could think of dreaming a dream
Where I cannot, where I cannot
Less morose and more present
Dwell on my gifts for a second, a moment
One solar flare, we're consumed
So why not spend this flammable paper on the film that's my life?
High flights, inhale the vapor, exhale once and think twice
Eat some shrooms, maybe have a good cry about you
See some colors, light hang glide off the moon
In the dark, in the dark
I'd do anything for you (In the dark)
I'd do anything for you (In the dark)
I'd do anything for you (In the dark)
I'd do anything for you (In the dark)
I'd do anything for you, anything for you (In the dark)
I'd do anything for you, anything for you

One, two
Moon River, wider than a mile
I'm crossing you in style someday
A dream maker (Maker)
My heart (You heart) breaker
Wherever you're goin', I'm goin' that way (Same)
Two drifters off to see the world
There's such a crazy world to see
We're all chasin' after all the same
Chasin' after our ends
Moon River, wider than a mile
Crossin' in style someday
My dream maker, heartbreaker
Wherever you're goin', I'm goin' the same
Two drifters off to see the world
It's such a crazy world, you'll see (What I see, who I become, what I see, who I become)
We're all chasin' after our ends
Chasin' after our ends
Life's just around the bend, my friends
Moon River and me

Bad luck to talk on these rides
Mind on the road, your dilated eyes watch the clouds float
White Ferrari, had a good time
Sweet sixteen, how was I supposed to know anything? (Love)
I let you out at Central
I didn't care to state the plain
Kept my mouth closed
We're both so familiar
White Ferrari, good times
Stick by me, close by me
You were fine, you were fine here
That's just a slow body
You left when I forgot to speak
So I text the speech, lesser speeds, Texas speed, yes
Basic takes its toll on me 'ventually, 'ventually, yes
Ah, on me 'ventually, 'ventually, yes
I care for you still, and I will forever
That was my part of the deal, honest
We got so familiar
Spending each day of the year
White Ferrari, good times
In this life (Life), in this life (Life)
One too many years
Some tattooed eyelids on a facelift
Thought you might want to know now
Mind over matter is magic, I do magic
If you think about it, it'll be over in no time
And that's life (Love)
Love (Love)
I'm sure we're taller in another dimension
You say we're small and not worth the mention
You're tired of movin' (Woo), your body's achin' (Woah)
We could vacay, there's places to go
Clearly, this isn't (The way) all that there is
Can't take what's been given (No way)
But we're so okay here (We're fine), we're doing fine (We're fine)
Primal and naked
You dream of walls that hold us in prison (Love)
It's just a skull, least that's what they call it
And we're free to roam

The title, “bricks and steel,” refers to the wall that Frank sees as separating him and his girlfriend:
If a tree fell in the forest
And no one was around to hear it
Baby, does it go boom?
Does it go boom?
If I have love for ya
But you were never close enough to feel it
Is my love any good?
Is my love any good?
Oh
But the distance ain’t even a room away
You’re laying in the bed right next to me
But there might as well be a brick wall in between us
Some soundproof glass
And some bars in the middle
Oh baby, when I wanna talk to you
I’m conversing with bricks and steel
A pile of bricks and steel
And when I tap your shoulder
You’re cold as bricks and steel
A pile of bricks and steel
How do I stay in love with your rubbish
All the leftovers and garbage
Was it ever real
If you were never here?
Bricks and steel, walk around my kitchen
Like a pile of bricks and steel
Bricks, bricks
Steel, steel
I know you’re somewhere in there
Sometimes I wanna pick up a hammer
And start chiseling away, away
Chiseling away, away
Girl my phone bill is crazy
The rate is sky high when I call ya
But you only let it ring
You only let it ring, oh
But the distance ain't even a room away
You’re laying in the bed right next to me
Oh but there might as well be a brick wall in between us
Some soundproof glass
And some bars in the middle
Oh baby, when I wanna talk to you
I’m conversing with bricks and steel
A pile of bricks and steel
And when I tap your shoulders
You’re cold as bricks and steel
A pile of bricks and steel
And how do I stay in love with your rubbish
Shorty leftovers in garbage
Was it ever real
If you were never here?
Bricks and steel, walk around my kitchen
Like a pile of bricks and steel
Bricks, bricks
Steel, steel
Stomp, stomp
I think I hear ‘em coming down the hall
He don’t hear a word I say at all
I’m wishing these 4 walls could talk, talk
Oh, stomp, stomp
I think I hear ‘em coming down the hall and
He don’t hear a word I said, oh, oh, oh
Oh baby, when I wanna talk to you
I’m conversing with bricks and steel
A pile of bricks and steel
And when I tap your shoulders
You’re cold as bricks and steel
A pile of bricks and steel
How do I stay in love with your rubbish
All the leftovers and garbage
Was it ever real
If you were never here?
Bricks and steel, walk around my kitchen
Like a pile of bricks and steel
Bricks, bricks
Steel, steel

Woo! (Woo, woo)
Woo! Highs and lows (Highs, highs)
Highs, lows (Highs and lows)
Highs, woo!
I was in all them hours in it
10K, tokin' mid strokes
Prime, prime time of my life witcha
Puttin' prime numbers up though
On them 7-7-7 flights witcha
Take a shower wit' it, gotta cleanse it
Keep the safety off innit
Now we finna have a mini
Outta wedlock, God forgive it, then forget it
'Cause only God can forget it
All this hotel living
Might as well pay the mortgage, what I'm spending
Said the dick long as a swan neck
Put some real swans in the pond then
Fell asleep in the foreign
After the free show at The Garden
Let the LED roll Deer Hunter
Leave the stage, watch it from the audience
Bet we sell the bickets out next week
On me, on my bodness
When I'm up, they gon' hate
When I'm sideways, yeah, I set me straight
When I'm up, they gon' hate
When I'm down, they gon' celebrate
Sittin' sideways, too sideways
Nah, it's not too late

I will always love you
How I do
Let go of a prayer for you
Just a sweet word
The table is prepared for you
Ooh (Ball so hard, boys, boys flex, ball so, ball so hard, boys, boys flex)
Ooh (Ball so hard, boys, boys flex, ball so, ball so hard, boys, boys flex)
Ooh (Ball so hard, boys, boys flex, ball so, ball so hard, boys, boys flex)
Wishing you godspeed, glory
There will be mountains you won't move
Still, I'll always be there for you
How I do
I let go of my claim on you
It's a free world
You'll look down on where you came from sometimes
But you'll have this place to call home, always
This love will keep us through blinding of the eyes (Godspeed, glory, oh)
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind (Until it's time)
This love will keep through blinding of the eyes (Oh)
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind (Oh)
This love will keep us through blinding of the eyes (Oh, it's 'til it's time)
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind (We die)
Oh, oh
I'll always love you
Until the time we die
Oh, oh
