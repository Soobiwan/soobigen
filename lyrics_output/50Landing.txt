I don't want to call you up, won't call you tonight
I don't want to call you up, won't call you—
(Fifty)
You've changed up
Your heart's crushed
Can't give you all of what you want
A circle
Of surface
The same way he was on your mind
And if all I had was a dollar to spare
I would spend it on a safe way back
And I stared up to your window sill
Wondering, I was wondering, yeah
I don't want to say it, but it's different inside
I don't want to call you up, won't call you tonight
I don't want to say it, but you playin' my mind
I don't want to call you up, won't call you tonight
It felt right on the first day
Came and went and we turned to the wrong page
A long haul, it's the long road home
I was dead wrong and it stayed so cold outside
And I just want to feel like there's something inside
Don't gotta say a word the way you're hidin' your eyes again
Can't pretend you said what you said
I don't want to waste a day overthinking your mess
I'm not sad, I'm just broken
Bent over time that you've stolen from my nights that could've been hopeful
Outside your window, still snowin' down
I tried to fit, but I'm getting out
Gave all to give, but you let me down
Lost in your world
I'm not the answer
And if all I had was a dollar to spare
I would spend it on a safe way back
And I stared up to your window sill
Wondering, I was wondering, yeah
I don't want to say it, but it's different inside
I don't want to call you up, won't call you tonight
I don't want to say it, but you playin' my mind
I don't want to call you up, won't call you tonight
I don't want to say it, but it's different inside
I don't want to call you up, won't call you tonight
I don't want to say it, but you playin' my mind
I don't want to call you up, won't call you tonight

The curtains haven't closed yet
It surely must go on
But can't you see we haven't won?
And you should realize
There's nowhere I can run
And nowhere left to hide
There's no words left unsung
Cause driving ain't so bad when you're asleep
And foolishly colliding in our dreams
And every night I told you that I'd be waiting
Here for you, yes it's true, I'm not coming to
Don't wake me up
Can't see the lines ahead of us
Are we falling back this time?
A newly lain down vision
In the front room of our mind
And you should realize
There's nowhere I can run
And nowhere left to hide
It's over before it's begun
Cause driving ain't so bad when you're asleep
And foolishly colliding in our dreams
And every night I told you that I'd be waiting
Here for you, yes it's true, I'm not coming to
Don't wake me up
And you should realize
There's nowhere I can run
And nowhere left to hide
There's no words left unsung
And you should realize
There's nowhere I can run
There's nowhere left to hide
It's over before it's begun
And I wanna be able to do this for a living
But fuck man, it's hard
The fact that nothing here is permanent
I'm scared to go to sleep sometimes
I mean, I want to make what I have count
It's like, I want to live a fulfilled life
And do what I'm passionate about
And that is make music and meet people
And have an impact on someone
It's everything I live for, I just want to, to be happy

We were still holding on longer
It's not fair when you're out of reach
Said you hold 'til the summer
But I still felt you let go of me
They said you're out of luck
I had to face it with no light on, so shaken up
There lie decisions avoided
Like incisions embroidered
Right to my bones
So undecided how I walk like that
And to think I had it all, you said you've lost it
Went on a separate way, no
Never feeling the same
It's always all games to you
Nothing to prove, nothing to prove, oh, oh, yeah
(I wouldn't change that for thе world)
We were still holding on longеr
It's not fair when you're out of reach
Said you'll hold 'til the summer
But I still felt you let go of me
It's all the time I left wasted
Oh, but how could I regret it?
This odyssey, whoa-a, oh-h-h
Serene and the water freezes
That summer blew by like autumn leaves, and oh
It gets hard to grieve when the night comes fast
And honestly, I don't know how to cope
It's a lost cause, I wanted you to know
There's nothing to prove, and
I'm trying to let it go
I had a feeling you waited to say
I had a choice and I made it
I took the long way
I wasted all my time
Regretting lack of patience, so patiently
We're still holding on longer
It's not fair when you're out of reach
Said you'll hold 'til the summer
But I still felt you let go of me
It's all the time I left wasted
But how could I regret it?
This odyssey, this odyssey
This odyssey, this odyssey
Still, still, still, still (This odyssey, this odyssey)
Still, still, still, still (This odyssey, this odyssey)
Still, still, still, still (This odyssey, this odyssey)
Still, still, still (This odyssey)
It's a long way back and it's been a long road
And I'm pretty sure things have changed, no
Started getting that feeling deep that time is really bleeding out
Took a step back, watch the color turn black and show that age
Light leaking, it's confusing how to see it now
Can't afford to waste no more
Every step gone forth is another step back
And I wear it on my face and Mum said that son, "You need to get away"
So I went UK, saw my boys, felt the rain on my face
And we rode that train all day
And for a moment I could breathe and ease the weight
Can I breathe and ease the weight?
Can I breathe and ease the weight?
Can you feel the seasons change?
Can I breathe and ease the weight?
We were still holding on longer
It's not fair when you're out of reach
Said you'll hold 'til the summer
But I still felt you let go of me
It's all the time I left wasted
But how could I regret it?
Oh, how could I regret it? (Oh, how could I regret it?)
Oh, how could I regret it? (Oh, how could I regret it?)
Oh, how could I regret it? (Oh, how could I regret it?)
Oh, how could I regret it? (Oh, how could I regret it?)
Oh, how could I regret it? (Oh, how could I regret it?)
Oh, how could I regret it? (Oh, how could I regret it?)
Oh, how could I regret it? (Oh, how could I regret it?)
Oh, how could I regret it?
This odyssey

I don't wanna waste no love
I don't wanna waste my mind
I don't wanna waste my life
I don't wanna waste my time
I don't wanna waste no love
I don't wanna waste my mind
I don't wanna waste my life
I don't wanna waste my time
Four seasons on the sideline
And there's a reason for this timeline
We burn out like a wildfire
Walking on the wire now I'm chasing down the limelight
And you see what I reach for
I'm never playing with the retort team sport
We were never hittin' in the same weight
And I don't give a fuck about this pay grade
Cause this a new stage, stand on my own
Words on my page, and my life on my phone
I'm playin' this game moving alone
I don't know my city, I don't know my home
So I got nine more reasons not to trust nobody
Don't owe funds to a phony who gon' try me
Five more times that I gotta ask nicely
No more callin' but you all know where to find me
Фактов вообще не бывает
А уж здесь и подавно
Душу вложишь, сердце свое вложишь
Сожрут и душу и сердце!
I don't wanna waste no love
I don't wanna waste my mind
I don't wanna waste my life
I don't wanna waste my time
Scared of living
I don't wanna waste no love
I don't wanna waste my mind
I don't wanna waste my life
I don't wanna waste my time
Scared of living
And this the last time that I'll wait for the bell
And I don't need another hand 'cause I'm armin' myself
So when you see me on my own I'll be holdin' it well
'Cause I ain't got no time to be down in a spell
Brakence got my back, and we've been running the game
Yet it's funny how we closest, but I hop on the plane
And all these people in my mentions sayin' they'd do the same
For what you couldn't carry me up
I'm the brawn and the brain
I'm in charge of my change
Either money or fame
Saying I can't handle the heat, I've been harnessin' flames
I don't want to pack it all up in a suitcase
This is the last time, next I'm coming with a new face
I don't need a check on my gram or my shoelace
You don't need to tell me I'm a don, it's a new day
Don't hit my line, it's too late
Я сдохну
А через два дня меня забудут
И начнут жрать кого-нибудь другого
I don't wanna waste no love
I don't wanna waste my mind
I don't wanna waste my life
I don't wanna waste my time
Scared of living
I don't wanna waste no love
I don't wanna waste my mind
I don't wanna waste my life
I don't wanna waste my time
Scared of living

Call off all the arms
Time to lay your head back down
Cause I've been runnin' for
The line between what's lost and found
Tried to climb inside my head
Put the pieces back again
Sleepin' behind the wheel
We're drifting off the edge
And what are we supposed to do
When it comes to living fast and getting through?
Cause time will pass before we blink
Sat in silent rooms then pour another drink
If this is growing up then I don't know what to think
But time has come to move ahead
Don't hold it back just let it be
Our insight here you know, you get an insight
And you know something, you know?
But you don't wanna say it out loud
Because you're kind of afraid
That it's not gonna be really tuned
And it'll spoil the whole thing for you, you know?
But when somebody makes you say it
Then, then it's true
Then it just makes it more beautiful of a thing
Another empty face
Just more headlights in the distance
Filling empty space, of the times we're reminiscing
Holdin' back all of my dreams
Tryin' to point out who I'll be
Why are they afraid of living till the end?
And what are we supposed to do
When it comes to living fast and getting through?
And I can't see through my reflection in front of me
Can't take it back why live a life like we're asleep
Cause time will pass before we blink
Sat in silent rooms then pour another drink
If this is growing up then I don't know what to think
But time has come to move ahead
Don't hold it back just let it be
They can, they can tell us we're crazy
But we can say, "You wait"
"You haven't seen what we think yet"
Because there are things that are more beautiful
Cause I'm dying alone
I'm finally about to break (Fuck)
And I'm ready to grow
And how long is that gon' take?
Sunken eyed on a tightrope
Left home blindfold on a backroad
Slept in another sunrise
Guess I've got a long way left here to go
Cause it's a long haul to what we know
Or at least where we're heading for
No star is ever out of reach
The higher that we're heading lookin' down is steep
Soon enough the leaves will change
Bleedin' out till the colour fades
Movin' forward nothing stays the same
But I can sleep at night knowing my hand was raised
I hope to a god that I don't believe in
That I'll make it one day
So here's to the life I'm leaving
I'm growing up again

Who are you?
I don't really wanna talk
On the ice since a youngin' we were bound to flop
Hear it crack like the knuckles on a brick wall
'Cause we used to stand tall on the bike pedals till the leaves fall
Scraped knee till I bleed out
Learning how to feel now
But I feel now
Show my back and you're pulling out the steel now
'Cause it doesn't feel real now
Now I'm in the whip one way
And it won't slow down
And I'm tryna switch lanes before the
Light dies out
And I've fucked my brain up
And how we gonna take control
If all we are is talking fast and moving slow
Won't take it back
I'm done and that's a wrap
'Cause I won't fly away when I see you
Running back I don't need you
And I won't say what's wrong when
I was right
You fall in we fall down no sunrise just dark clouds above us
You're just burnt out
'Cause I won't fly away from this rebirth
Breathe first
Rebirth
Look
17 had me running by
Staring out the window at a sunny sky
Never had a question about the right ways
Got it locked down figured out at the right time
18 had my neck tied
Red eyed on my face like a headline
Deadlined on a great time in a cold sweat
Chest gripped merry-go-round now my preset
No more cycle gotta reset
Now I'm in the whip one way
And it won't slow down
And I'm tryna switch lanes before the
Light dies out
And I've  fucked my brain up
And how we gonna take control
If all we are is talking fast and moving slow
Won't take it back
I'm done and that's a wrap
How you gonna wake up
When she got on her makeup
And something's telling you that you're alright
Another bridge we break down
And nothing's gonna change now
And something's telling me that you're on fire
The flames are flying higher
Now I'm in the whip one way
And it won't slow down
And I'm tryna switch lanes before the
Light dies out
And I've fucked my brain up
And how we gonna take control
If all we are is talking fast and moving slow
Won't take it back
I'm done and that's a wrap
'Cause I won't fly away when I see you
Running back I don't need you
And I won't say what's wrong when
I was right
You fall in we fall down no sunrise just dark clouds above us you're burning down (Burning down)
'Cause I won't fly away from this rebirth
Breathe first
Rebirth

Dust will settle down
Before we hit the ground
And I called it, oh I called it
Nothing here to say
So I moved it far away
You were stallin', I was fallin'
These pains will heal now
And these times we feel out numbered
Falling under ourselves
And we can call it what we want
We'll be exactly what we need
I'm folding, bringing me to my knees
Lights go out
It's on my shoulders
But I'm still standing it's not over now
It's not over now
If I can find a way
Not to panic when I'm sober
Shoot me down I don't want closure
Moving closer
It's not over now
Iron sights in the crossfire
Crosswind on the drive better ride slow
Mountaintops, it's clear I've never been higher
Raise the bar, but you ceased to see you pulled it low
And we can call it what we want
We'll be exactly what I need
I'm folding, bringing me to my knees
Lights go out
It's on my shoulders
But I'm still standing it's not over now
It's not over now
If I can find a way
Not to panic when I'm sober
Shoot me down I don't want closure
Moving closer
It's not over now
It's falling to pieces again
These thoughts are all breaching in my head
Silhouette of the summertime
Ripped out another page with the underline
We stayed up till the last call
And I know it hurts to say but we went through it all
And we can call it what we want
We'll be exactly what we need
I'm folding, bringing me to my knees
Lights go out
It's on my shoulders
But I'm still standing it's not over now
It's not over now
If I can find a way
Not to panic when I'm sober
Shoot me down I don't want closure
Moving closer
It's not over now
Lights go out
It's on my shoulders
But I'm still standing it's not over now
It's not over now
If I can find a way
Not to panic when I'm sober
Shoot me down I don't want closure
Moving closer
It's not over now

Um, like say I send you a message and you reply like 3 or 4 days later and it just like, it kinda like sucks.
And I don't wanna cry when I'm
Safe but I'm losing my sleep
Running out of time so don't
Stay, don't follow me
It's not a question of loving or dissipation of night
I think I'm lost where I lie
Fucked up by the way to the journey
It's been a long run and it's likely it's hurting now, god
Lost touch with the way that we moved through the dust
Now I got no feeling again
And you wrote this the way that you want
Confined to this waste to buy time
And it's adding up
And I've had enough
'Cause I remember, late nights driving to Frank
No ocean in sight but I'm down by the lake and it's
2 AM and I'm seeing the way that I'm falling out of line
Am I caught in the wake I thought, damn
I don't know what's gotten into me
And you don't know the way that I've been off
You wrote it I'm hard to love
Love
I'm holding the weight of the world
Motions through dead of the night
Don't worry your eyes
And I don't wanna cry when I'm
Safe but I'm losing my sleep
Running out of time so don't
Stay, don't follow me
It's not a question of loving or dissipation of night
I think I'm lost where I lie
I need a minute to say
That I'm losing my bearings
And now I'm falling in straight
Down, I don't wanna go out
Send this away
Kinda wish that I could roll it all back to my car
And spend another school night
In the moonlight
And speed along the parkway
Just to hear you just say that I'm wrong
But time will go on
And I know it's nothing now
And the stars just don't look like they used to
They're missing some type of glow
And I lost the best piece of myself
On this ridge where we used to go
To higher heights

I fell in love with a girl who's gone now
She's sitting out there miles away
I've been alone for a while now
But I keep thinking of a face
And she said
You're too pretty to be lonely
But I can't look you in the eyes
So here's to hoping
I'll find you way up high
Oh maybe, oh maybe
In another life
I fell in love with a girl who's gone now
It's getting late and I fall asleep
She's waking up as she hears the clocks sound
And whispers right back at her screen
And she said
You're too pretty to be lonely
But I can't hold you late at night
So here's to hoping
I'll find you way up high
Oh maybe, oh maybe
In another life
I've never known where I'll be going
Never had a thing for settling down
But we don't have long
I could be wrong
But I still hear how you're in that same town
Alone
I fell in love with a girl who's gone now
It's been another lonely day
And I've been waiting for a while now
For this plane to head your way

I'll say it once and
I'll say it again
I said I'm done
Please don't let this out
Fall back down
Down
All my thoughts falling further
And you just showed up to waste my time
I fell in love with the way it hurts
I gotta die just to feel alive
And proof won't answer this question of lies
It got washed up through the mess in your head
And higher tides
And so you want love
In the city that doesn't hold sleep
Define trust
It's a pity that was the old me
To find lust
And I don't got no tears
To line my eyes
To hide my fears
Behind my guise
Still waiting for something to open my eyes
Distant from folding and wasting my night
'Cause I've been caught up
And I missed out
All my thoughts falling further
And you just showed up to waste my time
I fell in love with the way it hurts
I gotta die just to be alive
And proof won't answer this question of lies
It got washed up through the mess in your head
And higher tides
I'll say it once and
I'll say it again
I said it once
Please don't let this out
This won't hold longer
Desperate measures to walk the line
And my days are numbered and colder
But I'm bolder

Fuck
I can’t move slow (Fifty)
I can’t hide it there’s something more
I can’t let go
I can’t find what I’m lookin' for (ooh-ooh)
I can’t hide it there’s something more
I can’t let go, I can’t find what I’m lookin' for
Feeling so fucked up
Caught a wave headin' straight for the rocks
Tryna hold my gaze
Wait, stop
I just lost another train of thought
My throat burns I'm on fire but I can't speak
You're now live
You're on air now I can't breathe (oh)
Out lost track of the time chasin' old dreams down
In the past but we're dying and I can't sleep now
I don't wanna fuck this up again
Staring down the clock cause this gon' end
All is well
I'm pulling back cause I'm tired of fighting myself
I can’t move slow
I can’t hide it there’s something more
I can’t let go
I can’t find what I’m lookin' for (ooh-ooh)
I can’t hide it there’s something more
I can’t let go, I can’t find what I’m lookin' for
Body in the future and my head in the past tense
I would lie to solve any issue we had back then
Will I last long is this shit gon' die in plastic
Lost my first love and I started taking acid
I don't wanna fuck you up again
It's probably best if we stay friends
Got fuckboys tryna taint my image
I just hope I find peace of mind within
All this time that I've been given
That I don't need to live in the veldt
It's real life and I'm tired of fighting myself
I can't move slow
I can't hide if there's something more
(something more, something more)
I can't let go
I can't find what I'm looking for (ooh-ooh)
(I can't find it)
I can't hide if there's something more
(something more, something more)
I can't let go
I can't find what I'm looking for
Should we put this out?
Nah this shit is trash

And I know that you'll be my envy
But I know that you're not my truth
And if I've seen heaven
Was you're when you're with me, that's home
And if you hold the answers
I don't want to hear it from you
Let me go
And it hurts to leave
It's the only reprieve so hold on
So I'm floating, not folding
Still lost out at sea
Stop counting the weeks 'cause I'm done
Not being what I want
And I know that you'll be my envy
Ooh
But I know that you're not my truth
And if I've seen heaven
Was you're when you're with me, that's home
And if you hold the answers
I don't want to hear it from you
And it hurts to leave
It's the only reprieve so hold on
So I'm floating, not folding
Still lost out at sea
Stop counting the weeks 'cause I'm done
Not being what I want
The seasons change and so do we, so, this is it. Goodbye
I know your heaven is surely not mine
It's not a question, pretending we're fine
And we're breathing in present, so dying alive
Not written in starlight or said in a sign
Here lies no essence of paths we once tread
Just future and foresight a hand to be lead into
Ends with no silence where consciousness fled
There's beauty in trying

I think it's time we had a reset, no
It wasn't something I could see yet
(Deep breath, reset)
Why don't you tell me from the start?
I know it really really hurts to ask me
You know I could play the part
I know we're walking over broken glass, yeah
I can feel it in the dark
At last
Thought I'd never look back
Kept on running from the past you
Guess I didn't really have to
And I miss the clouds up high
On the hill where we were running
And I miss the sounds of night
Saying that I could be something like something to you
Or maybe I'll bе nothing
I've nothing to prove
They say it's paining thе changing of views
But hey, it doesn't matter where you fall
It all hurts the same way-
I think it's time we had a reset, no
It wasn't
It wasn't something I could see yet
Leaking poison in the air
You were holding my head down so I couldn't breathe in
(I need it)
It's kinda funny how you lose the plot
And then it starts to creep in
Cold sweat, beating
Lose touch, feeling
And I miss the clouds up high
On the hill where we were running
And I miss the sounds of night
Saying I could be something like something to you
Or maybe I'll be nothing
I've nothing to prove
They say it's paining the changing of views
But hey, it doesn't matter where you f—
I think it's time we had a reset
(Deep breath, reset)
It wasn't something I could see yet
(Deep breath, reset)
(I don't really got no time to waste)
Oh, and are you convinced I'm checked out
(Deep breath, reset)
White flags around
I'm losing sense of all direction, oh
(Deep breath, reset)
It gets so tiring running circles
(Deep breath, reset)
To nowhere fast
It's just a game until your time will pass
I think it's time we had a reset
A cold start
Reaching
I think I'm needing it
I'm not ready yet to leave here
Leave it
I'm leaving
I'm not ready to die
I think it's time we had a reset, ooh, no
And I miss the clouds up high
On the hill where we were running
And I miss the sounds of night
Saying I could be something like something to you
Or maybe I'll be nothing
I've nothing to prove
They say it's paining the changing of views
It doesn't matter where you fall
'Cause it all hurts the same way

In all my despair
I’m out of my mind I'm
So done
The world isn't fair
So I don’t really care
And it's all I have
But it's all I wanted
The world isn't fair
In all my despair
I'm out of my mind I'm
So done
The world isn't fair
So I don't really care
And it’s all I have
But it’s all I wanted

It eluded us then, but that's no matter
Tomorrow we will run faster
Stretch out our arms farther
And one fine morning, so we beat on
Boats against the current borne back ceaselessly into the past
So much I can tell you
And there's something about you
Telling me you're better off alone
And I know you don't wanna say that I'm gone
But save yourself before the future comes to light
(Yeah)
Lately haven't noticed myself
I've been holding on tight
Take it stow on the shelf babe
Cause' I've been living through the night
Another side that I'm hiding
Coming out when the light fades
Just another life phase
Caught out switch around never liked change
But you're sailing through it anyways
Heavy storms through the night bringing calm days
Grey skies always coming on
Mind running circles and the chest in a marathon
Gotta cut ties with the lie you're depending on
Moving too fast find the red need to stop it off
Cause we are falling deeper now
And history repeats itself
And well I'm not going back
Cause there's, so much I can't tell you
And there's something about you
Telling me you're better off alone
And I know you don't wanna say that I'm gone
But save yourself before the future comes to light
(Yeah)
Color coded in my thoughts now, drop down
Woke up in the city feeling lost now, hostile
Lookin' for a way to break your heart out, compound
Darlin' you don't gotta take the cards dealt
And it's okay if you gotta cry
Rain falls down every night
You'll know when it's all clear to see, yeah
So much I can't tell you
And there's something about you
Telling me you're better off alone
And I know you don't wanna say that I'm gone
But save yourself before the future comes to light
