Four years, really
Turn the lights on
I can stay awhile, but you wanna get me off
Think I don't say enough
I won't be runnin' back 'long as I'm faded and
Fucked up 'cause you're gone and the clique gone too
I turned to someone I could hold onto
I didn't understand how it would have backfired
Wonder who I am
Man, who the fuck am I?
I can't take a lie back, now it's stuck outside me
I can't take this shit lightly
If you want an ear, you know where to find me
High on IG, flirtin' with a couple homies
I said I'm too eager, couldn't keep you
And she told me, "Keep it lowkey, only rule is staying open"
I'm like, "Where'd my line go?"
You just stole it
Try and catch me tying up loose ends
I'm past that, now I wanna fuck all my friends
No patience, sick of being stuck in the end
I'm past you, didn't wanna fuck you again
Yeah, I just wanna fuck all my friends
No patience, sick of being stuck in the end
I never wanna fuck you again
I'm past that, now I wanna fuck all my friends
And I no longer plan to hide in the snow and wait 'til you hold my hand
Now there's a four in five chance that she'll get her fine friend
And I'll be a nine-ten to 'em
Fucked up 'cause you were gone and the clique gone too
Turned into someone people come onto
I didn't understand how I could've macked
Y'all gonna wonder who I am
Try and catch me tying up loose ends
I'm past that, now I wanna fuck all my friends
No patience, sick of being stuck in the end
I'm past you, didn't wanna fuck you again
Yeah, I just wanna fuck all my friends
No patience, sick of being stuck in the end
I never wanna fuck you again
I'm past that, now I wanna fuck all my friends
Try
Try
Try and—
Try and catch me, try and catch me
Try and catch me tying up loose ends
Try and catch me tying up a loose end
Try and catch me tying up loose ends
Try and catch me, try and catch me

I got you, I got you
I got you, I got you
(One, two, three, and)
They can keep the key
What might have been lost doesn't bother me
The wolves or sheep
With this blood on my hands
I'm making amends
I'll move slowly (Yeah)
And I've worried that you're worried
'Cause I wanted to be like my mama
And get stronger
But you can never put a label on me
We don't got no ID
And if everyone had their reply
I'm on read
I got you, I got you
I got you, I got you, I got you
I got you, I got you, I got you
(No)
I get burning eyes
Whenever I take my own advice
Is it really mine?
I want help, don't need luck
And I don't give a fuck if you want me to (Mmm)
I've learned it's gotta come from inside me
I don't need to rhyme
And I don't need no IV
I've been here all night
I can't think to forget for you, baby
I'll carry all of you on me
Ooh, we'll be fine now
I got you, I got you, I got you
And I got you, ohh-oh, and I got you
I got you, I got you, I got you, ooh-oh, no
When you hold my hand (Mmm)
I think we should make more plans
But you going out in San
What's the point of being friends?
But I'll never leave your IG hole
And if I fall out in that cold
I trust that you'll get over that
You wanted me to reaccept my end
I got you, I got you, I got you
I got you, I got you, I got you
I got you, I got you

You wanted to know where I've been
Now you’ll find out
I got a— (Uh)
I got a tab on my tongue, goin' twenty-five over the speed limit, I'm buggin’ (Bloomtodeath)
If you wanna find love, you should watch what kind of beliefs you're puttin' your trust in, yeah
Get out my car at the beehive, I heard the queen died of corruption
So I wanna hollow my funds, honey, keep that, I'm teabagging the cup
'Cause you gave me the butterflies
Now I'm stayin' up all night
So what can I do to make me get over you?
I'm letting go of all of my vices
I’ll make the sacrifices
All I can do to make me get over you
I wonder where I went
Tripped once for fun and I tore a ligament
We can’t blame this on ignorance
I'm falling apart, baby, I hope you is
I’m in for seeing the truth
And being the view
Just weave me anew, all new, all new
(This) Shit knocks too hard
Hit the left hook on them, the beat causing concussions, yeah
And he playing my song
Tryna decode, boy, ain't no need for the discussion
Spread out my heart, getting ego checks, so eternal my budget, yeah
And if it's bubblegum-pop, why you still down on your knees saying you love it?
Green tea and butterflies
Now I'm stayin’ up all night
So what can I do to make me get over you?
I'm letting go of all of my vices
I'll make the sacrifices
All I can do to make me get over you
I'm fallin' apart, did I really start that trend?
I'm starting to feel like I never knew my friends
My sunken eyes, oh, weren't they something nice?
But I just should modernize, it's all new, all new
So why you wanna link? I'd rather finger fuck strings
And I don't know how to be your lust king
There's a whole planet for what my money's spent on
Your God planned me out and I took His hands off, yeah
No, I don't wanna be intimate
You want me playin' you like an instrument
But I'm just gonna be listenin'
I'm fallin' apart, baby, I hope you did
Green tea and butterflies
Now I'm stayin' up all night
So what can I do to make me get over you?
I'm letting go of all of my vices
I'll make the sacrifices
All I can do to make me get over you

That's why I make 'em all silent (All silent)
That's why I make 'em so excited (So excited)
That's why I say I didn't try in the fire (Try, try, tr—)
I-I-I be lookin' all stylish
She said her boyfriend's bi and he tryna fuck
I don't gotta contrive it
Is it 'cause I break down when it's piling up?
Fe-Fe-Feet crushed by a mallet
Hit a brand new speed, add it to my palette, no talent (Uh)
My nails need a new polish
I'll show these motherfuckers how to find sauce in the rough
I-I found it stuck in my crib
You hit me online sayin' fuck promises
I wouldn't pass that up, said I never did
Now I haven't seen the sun in months
I can't afford to give a fuck
As soon as I get out, we'll get it in
So I better fuck off with the small talk
You can save the mileage
I poured sauce then it popped off
And I made it out here
I'm all up in your mentions and I know you 'bout this
I'm all over your main thing and he know about us
It's gettin' crowded for a nerd like me
I need space, rerouting, they reserved my seat
Got a new set of rules and they're molding me
'Cause I'm over them now and they over me, yeah
I-I-I be lookin' all stylish
She said her boyfriend's bi and he tryna fuck
I don't gotta contrive it
Is it 'cause I break down when it's pi-i-iling u-u—?
Feet crushed by a mallet
Hit a brand new speed, add it to my palette, no talent (Uh)
My nails need a new polish
I'll show these motherfuckers how to find sauce in the rough

No
What other effects?
I really know what's inside of me
And it was never enough
There's not a right or wrong side of me
From now on it's all lust
I'm never lying again
Spent my life sucking up
For a foe or a friend
Won't be fallin' in love
I-I've been staying up late on IG
'Bout time 'cause you talk just like me
Be patient and then fuck high-key
Leg shakin' in my 10 buck Nikes
Prozac make my hands fall asleep
Low blood sugar and some more caffeine
I don't need love, but I want that cheap
So fucked up that I laugh to pieces
Uh, I can't take it anymore
Fuckboys more fake than before
My hothead aches to my core
I'll hide that under my tongue
You won't be sinning for fun
I wanna fuck up my lungs
To hide the pain from my eyes
It's just so sick to my stomach
I really know what's inside of me
And it was never enough
There's not a right or wrong side of me
From now on it's all lust
I'm never lying again
Spent my life sucking up
For a foe or a friend
Won't be fallin' in love
Try
Try, no
If I'm honest, I don't give a fuck but
You're cut off, so you wouldn't know nun'
But whatever, 'cause you found someone now
I wanna be a dick for once
Until you know I'm not okay
'Cause everyone is so fucked up
The night is young, I know my fate
But I can't take it anymore
I'm way more fake than before
I wanna fuck up my lungs
I wanna bottle it up
I really know what's inside me
And it was never enough
There's not a right or wrong side of me
From now on it's all lust
I'm never lying again
Spent my life sucking up
For a foe or a friend
Won't be fallin' in love
Prozac, no
The Prozac—
The Prozac made me fuck my high school crush
In the back of this shithole van
Whether foe or a friend, whether foe or a friend
It's all to do with color- It's all to do with round, with shape. It's- everything's color. Everything, you know, is- ah, it must be to do with orange. Not only with orange. Oh, I haven't seen color, I live in a monochromatic world. I can't use color. I can do everything

Bloomtodeath
(I don't even wanna give you credit)
God, it's so funny (There I said it, uh)
'Cause I'm a, 'cause I'm a- ('Cause I'm a-)
Hypochondriac
I think of you, blood pressure spikes
I'll have a heart attack
The things I'd do to see you smile
But I never really want you back (bloomtodeath)
You got a new girlfriend and a frame of mind
But I don't even wanna give you credit
'Cause I'm jealous and I hate my life
Way down, get on my side (get on my, on my)
Stay down, get on my side
Wait til-, get on my side
But then I realized that it's all for you-ooh, you-ooh
It's all for you-ooh, you-ooh
It's all for-
A hypochondriac
I chеck the news, I'm terrifiеd
It's all my gut reaction
Become the latest fashion
'Cause when I'm in love with something, I'll break it
Got a heart of gold, but I'll waste it
Insanely high expectations
I gotta let it go and just face it, yeah
For now, I'm going nootropic (Way down, get on my side)
Get in place, speak down, you want something? I got it, yeah (Stay down, get on my side)
You in a mob and it show, I'm on that eight feet down (Wait til-, get on my side)
Got no heart but then (Way down if you're fucking with me)
It's all for you-ooh, you-ooh
It's all for you-ooh, you-ooh
It's all for you-ooh, you-ooh
It's all for you-ooh, you-ooh
It's all for-

I faked every moment
I thought I was so much better than that
I bet you don't think you would do me like that, uh
My brain decomposing
They're playin' a grown man, I'm closin' this app
Bitch, don't think you could do me like that, uh
Decayin' emotions
I'm jaded and no one's watchin' my back
Bitch, don't think you can do me like that, uh
So I'm takin' the potion
I'm breakin' the code with a chemical hack
I bet you don't think I could do it like that
I'm gone
I've been lookin' in the past for the reason, the devil inside me
Vision go black, bloodlettin' in white heat
Ambition apply more pressure to my pеak
Decisions align, I'm ready to dive deep
If this is thе time, just cut out the IV
Takin' that blade, just do it, Nike
Find God's freebase, I'm hidin' my IP (You're crazy)
Motherfucker got a stash just to get on my level and compete
Clear out my cache and I'll do it in one sweep
Cashed the gash for a medal, I just weep
And burn me to ash for meddling, don't cheat
This is just fate, not bravery
I found out why suffering tastes so sweet
This shit ain't love
I faked every moment
I thought I was so much better than that
I bet you don't think it would do me like that, uh
Decay and erosion
I'm jaded and no one's watchin' my back
Bitch, don't think you could do me like that, uh
I can't let it leave, I can't let it go
Can't heave myself off the pedestal
I know I needed to let you know
But I ain't never tried to speak with my chest before
But in episode two find a Liberty Cap
Go straight home make the bitter tea tap
Then God said, "Link make a suicide pact, uh"
Bitch, don't think you can do me like that, I'm gone
The fleece all on me as soon as the leaves fell
The road so bumpy, don't got a seatbelt
The coast so clear but I wouldn't seek help
You taught me some compassion while packin' a bowl
I was peekin' through the glass in the back of the show
You put me on track, I won't slack anymore
Now I'm movin' way past irrational
I said ain't it funny?
Got stung by a honeybee
It fell right in front of me
And if I knew well
Maybe I'll learn my lesson
Maybe I'll earn perspective
Maybe I'll take a second chance to slam the door to Hell
So I, I, I've been lookin' in the past for the reason, the devil inside me
Vision go black, blood, lettin' in white heat
Ambition apply more pressure than my peak
Decisions align, I been ready to dive deep
If this is the time, just cut out the IV
Takin' that blade, just do it, Nike
Find God's freebase, I'm hidin' my IP
Motherfucker got a stash just to get on my level and compete
Clear all my cache, and I'll do it in one sweep, yeah
Fear my wrath, full metal, I'm OP
And burn me to ash for metal and don't cheat
This is just fate, not bravery
I found out why suffering tastes so sweet
This shit ain't love, don't pray for me
I faked every moment, I thought I was so much better than that
I bet you don't think you would do me like that, uh
My brain decomposing
They're playin' a grown man, I'm closin' this app
Bitch, don't think you could do me like that, uh
Decay and erosion
I'm jaded and no one's watchin' my back
Pussy, don't think you can do me like that, uh
So I'm takin' the potion
I'm breakin' the code with this chemical hack
I bet you don't think I would do it like that
I'm gone (You have failed the mission)
(Go home and never come back)
She said, "Homie, get a grip", I said, "I'll sleep on it"
My preponent is a pad, get a peep of it
Each summer I get happy, 'cause I leave my home
I be runnin' from my past, it won't leave me 'lone
Sometimes I wanna get off of the seesaw
Sometimes I really wish I had amnesia
If you breathe love miss me with my weak lungs
If I want a honey, know I’m gonna be stung
At least once, so you know I gotta keep strung high
With a hunched back and a tough guy guise
I miss those days, I would touch their thigh
Sayin', "It's okay" to convince myself of it (Convince myself)
All I can do is put the pen to the pad
They stare at my pattern
The shadows are watching
Masters of the shadows
They're watching, they're following us
They're chasing us, can you see them?
Because you can't see it don't mean that it don't exist
Can you see the shadows? They're in the trees
You are now in a state of suspended animation

Can't you see it?
I'm trying
Oh, it's like you're released or you're free or...
I don't know how I can tell you
How do you feel inside?
Inside?
I don't have an inside
Is it all one?
I'll never call my friends
'Cause I don't have to
Yes, everything is one
I... You have nothing to do with it
I am one with what I am
I can see everything in color
Everything... you have to see the air
You can't believe it
And everything is coming down through you and moving
I have to see you every
Monday through Friday
I don't need help
How can you think it?
You-I... Can't you feel it?
You-I... Can't you feel it?
Everything is so beautiful and lovely
And alive

(brakence)
I don't know me outside this head
You reminded me of what I thought free meant
And so we made a friendship out of finding out who we are
And I’ve stopped trying since you told me
I'm only what I want
That ain't me
So could you call me over without the bitter hesitation
And place your money where your mouth is?
All my thoughts are clouded
But I can still say I’m 'bout it soon as my head gon' cave in
Oh and if I had the chance to remake all of my decisions
Well, I wouldn't take it
Because you got me fucked up but if I don't use this as agency
I'll never change
I'll never change
(Breathe easy)
Breathe easy

Call me over without the bitter hesitation
And place your money where your mouth is
All my thoughts are clouded
But I can still say I'm ’bout it soon as my head gon’ cave in
Oh and if I had the chance to remake all of my decisions
Well, I wouldn't take it
’Cause you got me fucked up but if I don't use this as agency
I'll never change
I'll never change
But sincerely it’s my fault
I've been chasing the answer to what it is we want
And I ain't found it out yet
But I'll wait for the right time
Gotta few bad voices, I might lie
So just tell me if you've had enough
I don't want you stressed out
So pray to God, the best of me is showing when I'm with you
Got a ways to go, my eyes are open is that an issue?
And I'm prone to show a lack of potency
It's like fuck my indecision, I need to restore my focus
'Cause I've been wasted on myself, I'll just let you know
Ain't past mistakes that I made, I don't let it go
I can't forget anything need you to hold me over once again
I take you everywhere with me
Waiting for a day to arrive
'Cause I can think I'm on fire
Every time you burn out my eyes
So call me over without the bitter hesitation
And place your money where your mouth is
All my thoughts are clouded
But I can still say I'm 'bout it soon as my head gon' cave in
Oh and if I had the chance to remake all of my decisions
I wouldn't take it
Because you got me fucked up but if I don't use this as agency
I'll never change
I'll never change

I get to movin' 'cause I'm fine
I know I never want to be him
So why the fuck's he on my mind?
I'm gonna find another reason
And I'll be puttin' up a fight
And if my eyes are ever leakin'
I'm gonna hide it, boys don't cry (Yeah)
Hate it when he's leaving
I get to movin' 'cause I'm fine
I know I never want to be him
So why the fuck's he on my mind?
I'm gonna find another reason
And I'll be puttin' up a fight
And if my eyes are ever leakin'
I'm gonna hide it, boys don't cry

"Ich muss nur wollen
Dann komm ich da wieder raus
Ich hab mich selbst reinfallen lassen
Dann komm' ich auch wieder raus
Die Erkenntnis reicht."
Baby, I'm bad with you
But I don't really need a head to be loose with truth
Want a little bit of that from you
'Cause I can't focus on my craft when I'm at the booth
And I been getting all these DMs at my table
They asking questions 'bout my style and my labels
Like you make EDM? That joke's a fucking fable
Pick it up and spit it back, soon it's gonna pay off
Middle finger to the labels that own men
I ain't signing I ain't doing this for more bands
You probably saying I'm a fake 'cause I'm on SVNSET
Got me fucked up 'cause a paper I ain't poked yet
And your main thing want me but I don't want her
Got one little baby I devote my love
And if you're chattering smack then just let me know my fault
If we ain't cool I'm willing to improve on it
I don't know what really hit me, I hope they fit
Catch me in they crib I'm grinning I'm fucking sick
And I'm sinning I ain't wishing, won't resubmit
Plus I'm always with my hippies I love 'em, kill me
Yeah I'm in another species don't want beef
I'm not so easy to retrace like your lost keys
You can see me going crazy you won't evade me
Only saying what you mean when your speech bleeds
And I swear you'll never take any chances to make it better
Honestly, she'd probably listen if you had something important to say
It's just we know that you not gon' let her speak
In past weeks I'd resort to phasing out of my setting for release
And I'm over it now you think you're more than that but it's been years since I felt this relieved
And all the smug talk
Compensates for everything you said that got me so lost
You don't wanna hear me maybe I should just stop talking
Plus you probably calling out my name now
I should have known
But I've always been sure that
You ain't know about my sound
You ain't know about this sound
Why you looking at me now
You done ran this to the ground
And we make mistakes 'cause we're young and we're stupid
But you've been a waste of time
I should have known
Fourthstrike

Screening my own headache for proof
The MRI was a misprint
Since you won't let me decide
Would you just tell me which side you're picking?
I'm not impressed with you
It's gonna go to my head
No, no, I don't need this bread
And I have tried to be there
For you, I'm sober as hell
Wonder what stakes are involved
I know you cried when I called
Why didn't I say somethin'?
I'm preparing myself, preparing myself
Preparing myself, baby, I don't need your help
Repairing myself, I'm just preparing myself
Rеpairing myself, I'm just preparing myself
Just call mе when you're sober and you wanna talk
'Cause I'll listen
And you can hide it with sex and try to regret it
I'm not impressed with you
It's over my head because I'm already dead
And I have tried to be there
For you, I'm open as hell
I hit the brakes, it won't stop
You put some miles in my car
Why didn't I say somethin'?
I was preparing myself, preparing myself
Preparing myself, I was preparing myself, yeah, myself
God is preparing myself with a DMT elf
And he gon' make me a toy, I am a God in a shell
Feed me some lead, maybe infect me instead
Please, just shoot me in the head and give me the pelt
Hahaha
Boy, you've gone crazy
(I see the fear in your eyes)
Memory's hazy
Why so lazy?
Why so flaky?
Don't embrace me
You've gone crazy
Mortal insects, witness my wrath (Oh my God)
Bloomtodeath (Why, why, why?)
Masters of the shadows (Why?)
(Help, help) King
(Help, help) Noble sacrifice
(Help, help, help, help, help)

Uncomfortably breeds growth (Okay)
That's the main thing I learned about it
In order for me to grow I gotta be uncomfortable as hell with everything
Do you think that it makes your music relatable in a way?
It makes me adapt
In which way?
Like, being vulnerable, having people come at me, like, surrendering myself to the world
Brakence
Looking for a stipend my drive is loaded
I think I can find it the more you know me
I just copped the right to extort my purpose
In a one track climate with no disturbance
All the same witcha, you believe your source shit

98% of all my flows are stolen
'Cause the greatest artists are the ones that notice
I get it going no I’m never turning it down
I’m finding my liking I strike indeterminates out and
If I’m all blood I’ll be flooding the tourniquet route
I’m breaking the boundaries I’m faking this tournament out
Like why lil' techie got a trendy flow
Because he reckons that it’d grant your trust
And he’ll be there in a second
A deceiver needs his love
I think I should probably get my will off the carpet
College next year, man the clock is alarming
Ain’t no excuses, no I do not give no pardons
And I'ma shoot a lot so I will hit my target
Brakence gonna move straight like a rook, vehement
Lead his favor wanna seize the paper like it’s old news: “dead president”
Sincere no fake layer even though he out his element
He gotta lotta fear but won’t stop there, only care a little if he relevant

I can't take inspiration from what they're doing (Yeah)
I can take inspiration from what other people did and blend them
Oh, in, like, in your own way, right?
Yeah, and that's what, that's what the new artists are doin'
I caught you dreaming
You’re soon to adopt how you find your meaning
I break my ceiling
I’m a lot, head’s hot but the baby freezing
That’s on my hearing
Still why would they love me I’m way past my season
For the time being
I will not give a fuck I don’t need no reasons
Make the best of your carbon print
Get your work up, do ya want all this, baby
You can’t just ponder bliss
Your vices control you, the common shit, baby
Gated path look like a hyphen
Brakence got talent but he ain’t no item
Lazy ass nerd 'bouta get to his writing
Don’t scrape that slack 'cause he just got a license
What are you tense for?
What’s the reason you got manners?
What do you stand for?
Look at me, I need an answer
Know you a man for 'em
Give your baby a little gander
Why the fuck can’t you advance demands with all these people tryna manage ya?
This ain’t no message it’s assault on your senses

Bloomtodea—
Tell me, dear lady, how will you navigate an uncertain future without the masters of the shadows?
Exclusive
I've been tryin' to breathe
Stayin' up past five, grindin' my teeth
Uh, I made a couple of beats
Then the whole 'net started capturin' me
This shit so overwhelming
Mix self-expression with self-obsession
Hellbent, but that's somethin' I don't wanna tell them
Fightin' for my will like the ring is Elden, fuckin' hell, man
Take a breath bеfore my ego pop
Play a set likе I'm a handmade prop
Put the clay in my oven, a petrified sufferer
Restrain it, that's fear-based art
Tainted flesh, it's why the photos cropped
I'm possessed the way I play my part
Farming hatred like gatherin' trading cards
Spirit degrading, that's fear-based art
I don't know why I can't sleep
Lurk 'til the birds chirp, sigh, and repeat
I hit control, alt, delete
And yet I can't stop manufacturing heat
It's the rapture of the beast, you can't grasp it in the least
Buying acid off the deep web
Blasting off for cheap
It's all my fault baby, I'm just too smart
And for that, I think I need to tear my brain apart, uh
Take a breath before my ego pop
Play a set like I'm a handmade prop
Put the clay in my oven, and petrify sufferin'
Restrain it, that's fear-based art
Tainted flesh, that's why the photos cropped
I'm possessed the way I play my part
Farming hatred like gatherin' trading cards
Spirit degrading, that's fear-based art
Shakin', I let it out, but I'm fakin'
How could I be so mistaken
To waste it on fear-based art? (Bloomto—)
Shakin', the power in me awakened
How could I be so mistaken
To waste it on fear-based art?
I'm guarded, they don't got my back
In my outlet, chargin' up a heart attack (Shakin')
With my head on a swivel, it give me muscle cramps (Breaking)
And I better not shrivel up, I'm a fuckin' man
It's so divine to judge
I started walkin' down that path beyond the winter months
I started flyin' to L.A. (Shakin') 'cause I could jitterbug
It drove me crazy (Breaking), now I'm certain I'm the chosen one, yeah
Take a breath before my ego pop (Oh no)
Play a set like I'm a handmade prop
Put the clay in my oven, and petrify sufferin'
Stain it, that's fear-based art
Tainted flesh, it's why the photos cropped
I'm possessed the way I play my part
Farming hatred like gatherin' trading cards (Ah)
My lungs are caving
Spent eight weeks tweaking in the basement
Found a problem in her statement
Do I trust her when she say she wanna get acquainted?
She say she wanna be my best friend
But I can't hang around no yes-men
Shovel fake love out the hole that I stepped in
No time, I already lost my adolescence
You think you're better than me?
But offline, you're nowhere to be seen
You think I'm lying that I'm lettin' you breathe?
Hangin' off your banister by my crooked teeth

I am using my imagination
I am using my imagination
I am using my imagination
I am using my imagination
I am using my imagination
I don't know how much more I can take
'Cause I'm gonna need more than sunlight or getting in shape
Weed makes me panic and Lexapro drives me insane
Tell me, how do you do what you love when you're sick in the brain?
And you're two thousand miles away
So why am I stalking your Twitter and lying awake?
I show my true colors, you left and my life got so gray
I can't get over you, yet I built up so much hate
But despite all the lies and projections, I hope you're okay
I'm not, I don't want to escape
I pop and my ego deflates
I'm starin' me down, I'll surrender to sound
Just to find out that I was a fake
(I'm not, I just want to escape)
(I pop and my ego deflates)
(I'm starin' me down, I—)
'Cause behind the smile, I'm so pissed
But I won't be showin' emotions
No, I'm not even tellin' my close friends
You can't fix me now, I'm too broken
I don't know why I'm witherin' this way
Think I'm always makin' a mistake
I close my eyes, just hopin' my neck breaks
Now I'm hardly copin', I don't know how much more I can take
I'm lost, I can't find an escape
I pop and my ego deflates
While starin' me down, I'll surrender to sound
Just to find out that I was a fake
I'm not, I just want an escape
I pop and my ego deflates, it's
Starin' me down, I'll surrender to sound
Just to find out that I was a—
A fluke, I got a tab in my pocket
It's what I use to justify all the fab I prophet
When I produce a beat, it's like makin' laced nootropics
I blow a fuse, repeat it, eternal state, neurotics
As I was splitting my hair, it's all a vanity fair
I'll leave the body I wear
And you can bring me to Hell
Yeah, you could tell it was the lie that you were the one
I'll play it out in my mind, what I could've done
And keep wondering if I'll write when my time is up
I can't help but picture my life ending in a month
And baby, you can try to love me, but I'm not fazed
I'm straight flushed with poker on my face
Then I start to choke on my own weight
Now I'm hardly copin', I don't know how much more I can take
'Cause my whole personality's fake
And I want someone else in my place
That'd feel so much better, I'll settle for now
An endeavor to die or create
Don't fail me
Die or create
Ahh
Settle for now
Bloomtodeath
Bloomtodeath
Bloomtodeath
Bloomtodeath, bloomtodeath
Too excited about dying, and blooming, umm—

I have nothing else to say
A sign falls
Nothing is wrong
You just don't see it
And I can't tell you how I feel
'Cause it's not what you'd want to hear
And I can't dismiss your silence out of patience
'Cause I don't have that
I don't have that

You got a dirty mouth
You're talking slick, the air is thick with your addictive doubt
It's obvious you want some shit
But you can't spread it out
I can't believe you kiss your mother with that dirty mouth, dirty mouth
When you start to trust me
I start to look at you funny
Do you even trust yourself?
(1, 2, 3)
Can you spare a little decency?
You can tell me what you want from me
Baby tell me what you want, tell me what you need
Baby tell me what you want from me
What's it gonna be?
But boy you're burning out
Deep fried your brain in entertainment
Please get out the house
It's all fun and games to get the same
It's what you bitch about
This summer rain has hit your game
And now you're burning out, burning out baby
When you start to trust me
I start to look at you funny
Do you even trust yourself?
(1, 2, 3)
Can you spare a little decency?
You can tell me what you want from me
Baby tell me what you want, tell me what you need
Baby tell me what you want from me
Wishing well, you're getting in too deep
You can tell me what you want from me
Baby tell me what you want, I'll do everything
Baby tell me what you want from me
Just set it free
No no no no no
I give you everything you ask for (Nooo)
The hell you react what's in the airport of the deal
Can you spare a little decency?
You can tell me what you want from me
Baby tell me what you want, tell me what you need
Baby tell me what you want from me
I can't help it when
It is freedom or a path you seek?
Can you tell me what you want, I'll do everything
Won't you tell me what you want from me
No no no no, could it be?
I've fallen from my palms
Leading me home
'Cause down by the water I'm harder to set me free



Bloomtodeath
Whenever I approach you
I'm always getting close to
Sayin' it out loud
So take out all the O2
The autumn wind will blow through
You're never gon' find out, out
He said, "Curse that fallen angel"
How I'm scrapin' up a scheme to serve the plot
(Don't get in my fucking way)
And I know I'm gonna raise Hell
One mistake after another, I forgot
I do not want you to save me
Boy, I know you love your girlfriend
And she's all you'd ever need
'Cause her love comes straight from source
And I'm a force of social greed
And the doctor said I'm bugging
But I swеar I'm gonna choke
If I keep talkin' in circles
We could trеat it like a joke
But if I had you
I wouldn't have to
Boy, if I had you
Nah, I couldn't have you
There's nothing left to turn to
I'm puffing on your virtue
Just to wear my crown (See look, I'm a person, I'm a good person)
I took out all the O2
Hollowed out the whole room
Now I can't make a sound (Like are you proud?)
Now my hair is getting tangled
And I gave up on my body, let it rot
I think he wants my spot, boy, just take it (Ahh)
And I know I'm gonna raise Hell
And mistake you for a lover I forgot (A new persona in Oklahoma)
I do not want you to save me
Now it's pure dissociation
Maybe I'm already dead
'Cause I'm spendin' every moment
With this existential dread (I'm shaking)
And the doctor said it's nothing
But I swear I'm gonna choke
If I keep talkin' in circles
We could treat it like a joke
'Cause if I had you (I'm missin' something)
I wouldn't have to
Oh, baby, baby, if I had you (I'm missin' something)
Boy, I thought maybe I could have you
But I couldn't have you, I couldn't have you
Turn me the fuck up!
Global domination
Your soul is mine (Fatality, mm)
Master
(Money, ugh)
You're listening to—
The masters of the shadows, tell me, dear lady
(Can you see the shadows?)
How will you navigate (He's a monster), an uncertain future
Without—, exclusive content (Shut up)
There is nowhere to run
You are now in a state of suspended animation
Magic, mm
The dark side, death is all you will find here
Evil is being carried on the winds of change
Hahaha, yes, a noble sacrifice
Mm, so real, I know you're a monster, but I love you, I love you
King
This is a message from the twelfth of thirteen (Quiero tenerte pa' mi)
Brakence has been successfully eradicated (Quiero tenerte pa' mi)
We came to the conclusion that he would rather make selfish art than serve a higher purpose (Quiero tenerte pa' mi)
So when you hit replay, ask yourself these questions (Quiero tenerte pa' mi)
Who are you really listening to? (Quiero tenerte pa' mi)
And where is the line between art and dark magic?
Because that man had no idea
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Oh, baby, I only wanted you
I couldn't say it so I'm typin' it on the cue
I fuckin' hate it so I died like a Montague
You think I'm chasin' something, I only wanted you
I found the truth
In solitude
It's concrete proof
That we're all screwed
I only wanted you
I'm eating Lucy in the sky, what you tryna do?
You think I made it? That's a lie, fuck your point of view
I never say this shit, but I only wanted you
I only wanted you

Now there's too many people that I have done wrong
And that I owe my thanks to for sticking along with me
Along with me
(One, two, three, and)
Think I'm dreaming
This isn't real
'Cause you leave in a month
And I'm fiending for something to feel
When you hold me
Know you know me down to my core
This is the calm before the storm
You diverted attention away when I mentioned
That someone else gon' need you more
Now there's too many people that I have done wrong
And that I owe my thanks to for sticking along with me
Along with me, oh, oh
(Who are you?)
And I fell apart in that bed
What we built isn't me
Won't put it back together again
(He didn't answer me)
I can't take back what I said
I just look through those messages I left on read
Ooh, and I took you to Rosier
'Cause I thought we could cope
We got out on the ocean, I fell out my boat
And you calmed me back down
And you gave me some hope
And I tossed that away for a seratone
Now there's too many people that I have done wrong
And that I owe my thanks to for sticking along with me
Along with me, oh, oh
(No commitments, no commitments) No commitments
(No commitments, no commitments) No commitments
(No commitments) No commitments (No commitments), no
No commitments (No commitments)
No commitments (No commitments)
No commitments (No commitments)
No commitments, no commitments
I'm going to Hell, you're going to Heaven
It doesn't negate our holy connection
And next time I fly too close to the sun
I'm not gonna run, this shit was for fun
(Fifty, fifty, fifty)
I left home now I'm fucked up
Realized how much I loved you
Whole goddamn life, been a suck-up
Now I'm just tryna get my luck up
All the pain went when you kissed me
We were ten toes up, now I'm six feet down
Moved on, you don't need me now
Now I gotta figure me out
Ah (Brakence)
No, I gotta figure me out, oh-oh, yeah, uh
Bitch, I'm up next
Fuckboy ain't a threat
Put a price on my head
Won't sell my soul for a check
That's on God, that's on sound
You won't ever see me 'round
I'll be cookin' up some shit that'll probably get me out this town
So far, are these visual things the only effect you find?

How this shit ain't obvious to you? I'm not even twenty-one
My music be the snobbiest, somehow I'm still gon' get it done
And I ain't do this for the audience, hold me down, I already won
I know I'm dope as fuck, I guess I'm glowin' up
(You are watching a master at work)
(Quiet on set, quiet on set)
(I'm using my imagination)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
I blew out my chakras, I ain't need no doctor
I be sippin' straight black, whippin' out the Honda
I be spittin' this shit too fast, I can't keep a saunter
I'm gon' give away excess cash, greed'll fucking haunt you, yeah (Uh)
A bad bitch with the messy hair
Yeah, I've been on my own shit and I never cared
So done with the good for nothing
The, "Why so sеlf-assured? You're bluffing"
It's all personal
If I fuck with your shit, you bеtter take it personal
I'm murderin' any beat you send me 'cause I'm versatile
But if I ain't like your shit, then you won't get a verse at all
I came to vibe, but he just wanted to dap me up
And I don't fuck around
Boy, I'm leavin' that beat deceased, put it underground
Puttin' in elbow grease, takin' back the crown
I'm just makin' a masterpiece from my daddy' house (Chorus)
How this shit ain't obvious to you? I'm not even twenty-one
My music be the snobbiest, somehow I'm still gon' get it done
And I ain't do this for the audience, hold me down, I already won
I know I'm dope as fuck, I guess I'm glowin' up
How this shit ain't obvious to you? I'm not even twenty-one
My music be the snobbiest, somehow I'm still gon' get it done
And I ain't do this for the audience, hold me down, I already won
I know I'm dope as fuck, I guess— (Don't stop)
Hit me double bound, I still be the one
This shit goin' South, I still see the sun
In it, here and now, I ain't gonna run
To a savior or a harbor, or a haven
Dope shit's never on purpose
Tryna keep it controlled, it's so worthless
Still in my prime but it's like I ain't been before
'Cause I'm never on time, gotta let that shit find me
Give me a moment
I'm dizzy off the sound 'cause I mix it potent
So then I'll break it down into its components
You do it for the crowd? That's a bad omen, oh (Ooh)
How this shit ain't obvious to you? I'm not even twenty-one
My music be the snobbiest, somehow I'm still gon' get it done
And I ain't do this for the audience, hold me down, I already won
I know I'm dope as fuck, I guess I'm glowin' up
Truth is gettin' obvious to me, I'm not even twenty-one
Music be the snobbiest, somehow I'm still gon' get it— (Get it–)
Do this for the audience, hold me down, I already won (Won)
Dope as fuck, I guess I'm—
Hands start to shake and I'm thinkin' rapidly
Bitch, I'm seein' the truth in my circle, just like it's alchemy
Don't get in the booth 'til the beats are defyin' gravity
Ears been fuckin' blessed with a curse to be the best on the Earth
It's non-duality the way I lose myself in the method
And the strategy is solid, I'ma beat it to death
I'm like a machine, I'm diggin' out dopamine
You're never gon' find it, keepin' it quiet
Stay up all night and make the hardest shit you've ever seen
I don't fold under pressure
Yeah, whether manic, love, or depression
Every body-mind shift, I'm growin' the vessel
Half you motherfuckers feedin' off my essence
Yeah, brew too cold, they need a refresher
Yeah, I'm gon' wield this art like a weapon
'Cause I'm seein' past all the bullshit
Pit me on the pulpit, pick it out, it's only my perception
Now I decide
So use this shit as a guide when makin' that fuckin' type beat
And good luck findin' anyone like me
I got the whole scene weighin' on my psyche
'Cause I'm desperate for progression
Bring it closer to perfection, every session
When we linkin'? Uh
Pain poised when I make noise, cap get diminished
I'm too advanced for the game, boy, I'ma need a minute
(Truth)

I am using my imagination
I wanted strength, I wanted luck
I wanted money and fame
I wanted everyone to love me and be under my reign
And when an arrow dipped in poison hit the path that I'd take
I knew I never had a choice and it was all up to fate
To pay the cost to chase a dream
I started starin' at a screen
Now I know everything, boy, I know everything
And now I'm tearin' at the seams
And only God can hear my screams
'Cause I know everything, boy, I know everything
Oh, how I'm lеarnin' like a fool, I'm always uppin' the pace
I said, wе're chasin' somethin' beautiful or get out my way (Me)
Through all the power trips, the cowardice, the pleasure, and pain
I found that me, God, and the devil are all one and the same
I've met my end (You're a monster)
You told me from the start
I'm making evil art (Yeah)
Why you actin' like you my friend? You know nothin' about me
I'm ready to ascend, you could double the bounty
Motherfuckers all pretend, but the data don't doubt me
I'm stickin' to the plan, bitch, I'm movin' devoutly
I've already found me, you all love to waste time
I'm hearin' it loudly, climbing up the grapevine
I'm up in the canopy, way above the baseline
Invert the polarity, put a hole in spacetime
To pay the cost of my regime
I started starin' at a screen
Now I know everything (King), boy, I know everything
And now I'm tearin' at the seams
And only God can hear my screams
'Cause I know everything, boy, I know everything
(Yo, back it up, fuck)
I got everything I wanted, everything, everything I wanted (The ritual is now complete)
I got everything I wanted, everything, everything I wanted
(Ooh, oh, oh)
I got everything I wanted, everything, everything I wanted
I got everything I wanted, everything, everything I wanted (A noble sacrifice)
Open your eyes
Open your eyes, just breathe
Breathe, don't look up
I don't wanna lose you
Stop, talk to me

And she said afterwards that like
Anytime I touch her it was just soft
You know it wasn't the harsh or an act
It was just like floating and it was just different
I-I sat for an hour with the groom we both just explored each other’s faces with our fingers, you know
It was— It was just beautiful I mean it was just incredible because
Well, that's— That's your attitude toward everything, I mean
You just wanna re-examine things that you’ve just taken for granted
(brakence)
I'm tired of feeling the same
So find me breaking up the world with a smile on my face
And I am letting go of anxious things I don't need to say
I don't need anyone's attention, I just need to replay
And I'm finding what I can make
So if you're looking for a staple, you can get out my way
And I just want the people 'round me to be stuck in their place
Don’t need to stay so apprehensive if I just stay awake
It’s you need me or you don't, girl
Say, "I don’t need you, I need your world"
Everyone is moving forward
With their conscience and their God's plan
So give me more of what you wanted
Give me what you never saw
When you wouldn't look me in what I meant
But it's alright if you need some more time
To reflect on who we are in my head
I’ll be frozen under sleep when I return
Like, no, I can't keep that I know you to myself
I can't keep that I know you to myself
And suddenly the grass, relaxed us, it allowed us to be the people we really are and really were



We've all done wrong things
With the certainty that I'ma leave here while still breathing
I would never have believed that I would do this
(Don't know)
I'ma shout into the sun that
I won't stop until it's done
I won't stop until it's finished (Yeah)
Don't need to play fair, I don't even really care
I won't stop until it's done with
I won't stop until it's finished
(I can do everything)
Drank a couple Janes, now I'm waiting for you inside
Might just fuck around and fuck around because it feels right
Moved two thousand miles and they ask why I was distant
Won't keep no feelings, don't make a difference
Don't need to play fair, I don't even really care
No, I don't need you—
Nah, I don't need—
I don't need to play fair
I don't even really care
I don't even really care (Yeah)

You wanna be that way
Well,  dive in
Dive  in my holy ghost
I was never worried 'bout the six feet
I just wonder why it wouldn't kill me
I  ain't get above in the fifties
And  I know this isn't makin' up for lost time
No difference made, but now I know mine
Makin'  the same mistake for my whole life
Now I'm gotta keep it all tongue-tied
Forty-five minutes 'til you're really gettin' tired
And you'll keep your distance, oh my God
I  don't need the time, I just want your love
And no thought and prayers and heartfelt lies gon' play
I guess I don't know the faith I got
It wasn't myself, it wasn't my boss
And now all this searching brought me back to say that
I don't care 'bout a stare or judgment
I don't care, I don't care
And I don't care what your friends want from me
Play it fair, I don't care, no, no
I don't care 'bout the 'gram to prove nothing
Breathe on air, I don't care
Locked out heaven like I can't upset
I don't need the time to decide I like it the best
I just came for it
Now I got a commission
I ain't even 18 and I found me a mission, yeah
Fu-Fu-Fuckboy treating art like a test
It's why he always got a issue, never givin' respect
So I just stick to plans 'cause this shit fun, now I got a mentor
Toxic engagement is not what I'm motherfucking meant for
I'll kill your reason with an MC Sony camcord
All the people staring so apparent
No, oh, I don't wanna play the game no more
I don't wanna play that game no more, oh
I don't wanna play, I don't wanna, uh
I don't wanna waste my funds
Doing somethin' I don't love, give a little bitty fuck, I don't, uh
I don't know where the passion in my subs
So I'll get it on my own, what's inside of me is enough like (Mmm)
I don't want no points, sin or holy (Yeah)
I don't call shots and I ain't no Kobe
I tried to wear a collar, tried to be a goalie
I'm done with all them roles, you can sell me off as a phony
I don't care 'bout a stare or judgment
I don't care, I don't care (I don't care)
And I don't care what your friends want from me
Play it fair, I don't care, no, no (Mm, no-woah)
I don't care 'bout the 'gram to prove nothing
Breathe on air, I don't care
('Cause I don't wanna play that game no more)
I don't care what you expect from me
I don't care, I don't care
(And uh) You wanna be that way
Well, dive in
Dive in my holy ghost
You wanna be that way
Well, dive in
Dive in my holy ghost
I don't care
But Jim—

Brakence in the second round now
And I don't even feel like I need a rest
Got a bag of the luck
EP next week and I'm unimpressed
Now I consider that I myself I'm a successful man in business
I hate business
Play this record as frequently as-
I hate everything to do with it;
Accounting, figuring, adding up numbers
Brakence
Because they're all arid. They don't smell of anything but sometimes there's an interesting smell to the ink on a checkbook But by and large I don't like it
Brakence in the second round now
And I don't even feel like I need a rest
Got a bag of the luck
EP next week and I'm unimpressed
At 16, I bought my boo a bouquet
17 years I'ma kill the kit in no saves
I just drop the habits that make my life fucking gray
I'm so jealous of my future I need to pick up the pace like
I don't wanna change my tone
But I couldn't do this on my own, ay
And if anybody call my phone
I'm like we get no beef, we're crop grown, ay
I don't even need credit
When I work witcha I'ma get hitched
Do my thing then I make connections
No one knows where I'm 'bout to go
And I'm done staring at the ceiling
With the thought that I'm gon' get there one day
Just give me answers, baby
At least my life is taking shape
'Cause I'm about to keep that up
Scream out my purpose
Gimme more time
Fuck my inhibition
Y'all don't need me you just feed me lies, you're not forgiven
We are words high
So I don't need prescriptions
Do y'all bleed
I don't think you got no nervous system
No one can stop me now
I'm worthless but I got sound
And I know
Who you are
And curiously there are very few roles in life which ah
Provide this possibility writer and sometimes musician
Sometimes the independent consultant can occupy this role
And I know
Who you are
Sometimes the independent consultant can occupy this role
I know that
This nerd will give it to you, promise you gon' not forget me
Got a hunch that you don't like me but I understand it
First hundred thousand people see my shit they get it
I just bought a vision tryna make sense of you
Nerd will give it to you promise you gon' not forget it
Got a hunch that you don't like me but that's all embedded
First hundred thousand people see my shit they get it
I just bought a vision tryna make sense of you
This nerd will give it to you promise you gon' not forget me
Got a hunch that you don't like me but I understand it
First hundred thousand people see my shit they get it
I just bought a vision tryna make sense of you
Now who's gonna listen to all this

What you do with people who are afraid and-and to some degree depressed, but certainly anxious is: you lay out what-what they're anxious about first of all in-in detail what is it that you're afraid of, what might happen, and then you decompose it into a small problem
And then you have the person expose themselves to the thing they're afraid of and what happens is that they get less afraid, that's what the clinical literature indicates exactly
What happens instead is that they get braver
You are known to be awkward
If she selfish, you wouldn’t walk over
You don’t even want to talk about it
You just want to hit the gas forward
You just want to fucking ask for it
You don't ever want to argue
You don’t ever want an issue
You don’t even gotta take orders
You know well, she never fake offers
Will it go to plan or cascade off it
In front of everything you made
Fuck it till you're confident enough for fucks sake
Gotta take off with your smug face
Gotta codepend on what’s next for you
You know how to do this well don’t you
Only done enough to fake
You been holding onto shit for a minute
You don’t need my luck you got retention
Only need to fuck up like you invented
Only reason why this worked out for you
And it’s looking like this time you got blurred vision
Only been up front since been forgiven
You don’t need no time to make a decision
You been thinking too much lately
There's-there's nothing simple or trivial at all about the idea of being called to move forthrightly forward into the strange and unkn-
You just wanna show her that you love
Cause in a minute you’ll be burning on rubber
Win a battle and you're trying not to lay back
You don’t wanna stay there underneath the covers
Face facts need a mouth before you mutter
Maybachs not for undercover
Wait that’s not good reason for the crying
You better look into her eye before the shutter
It’s only everything you wanted in the front row
Know you been faking ever since the sun rose
Every week you're thinking your luck froze
No more sheets can cure what you’ll upvote
So you just keep waiting for the time being that I'll walk out front
You been holding onto shit for a minute
You don’t need my luck you got retention
Only need to fuck up like you invented
Only reason why this worked out for you
And it’s looking like this time you got blurred vision
Only been up front since been forgiven
You don’t need no time to make a decision
You been thinking too much lately

Baby, you're a firework
Come on show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, "Awe, awe, awe"
You're gonna leave 'em going all

Hello, you have reached the third of thirteen's hypnotherapeutic veneficium cyber delivery portal. We have successfully trapped the man you may know as brakence and have no interest in returning him to your dimension. In fact, even he has no interest in returning. He has begun to build a relationship with our most talented contractor and is willingly participating in our emotional extraction program. Humans have a fascinating ability to force emotions down and let them build up ovеr time. Emotions that hold incredible powеr to the order of both love and hatred. Our species uses charged truth energy, which happens to be the byproduct of human emotional release, as fuel for interdimensional exploration. Sharing emotions among humans has been shown to cause empathetic chain reactions. We intend to publish this man's extractions in order to cause a chain reaction, leaving us with a fuel surplus. I will leave you with extraction 003, which unfortunately was damaged due to the man's excess resistance. We will be publishing increasingly potent extractions shortly. Thank you for your time
(I'm using my imagination)
I take it better when she don't even ask me
Three chords and she all over me nasty
She got me smothered, caught me buggin' her last week
Leave a scar on my soul, cause it's smarter to fold
I take it better when she don't e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e

You get an insight, and you know something, you know
But you don't wanna say it out loud
Because you're kind of afraid that it's not gonna be really true
And it'll spoil the whole thing for you
But when somebody makes you say it, then, and it's true
Then it just makes it more beautiful of a thing
I'm into you
It isn't my fault (Who are you?)
I'm into you, isn't my fault
No, I'm into you, isn't my fault
I'm into you (Who are you?)
Isn't my fault
And I am , know me
And I just walked out
Backwards forwards
It's all sequence
When is my head  breaks
When I'm thinking
I regret not taking chances (Who are you?)
Because I chose that ego was grantеd
And why did I resist friendship?
And I don't know why, but I meant it, oh

I just took- I just took a fourth of a tab of acid. I'm microdosing right now. And I'm by myself in this house and I'm whispering actually because there is someone home and they're across from me
Yeah
I know you wanna— (Yeah)
I know you wanna be me
I did it so y'all really don't have to
Eat, fuck, and make beats then I fall backwards
Could live my whole life on a twin mattress
Just had to realize that it's all practice
Dropped out in two weeks, I got no manners
She says she wanna fuck with a synth nerd from the suburbs
Ain't a lover or kisser
She don't care if you don't follow her on Twitter
She said her kink is people being honest with her
I've learned to do that
No, I don't overthink shit
I assume absolute fact
Kenny rode on my way in the cold to get
Tools for when old thoughts make me loop back
The crew mackin', I knew Jack before we met
School was trash, I got new cash and I'm not impressed
I'm psyched out, I fly South by South West
And meet friends from featuring on SVNSET
Fuckboy thinks comments are gonna stop me
Dismiss that, this shit's not a hobby
More than enough sauce in my skinny body
Big chillin' like Harlow, my eyes Sonic
So now I'ma really drop
These visions for 2020 when I'm landin' in 50's spot
If I had no streams, it would still feel a milli' hot
'Cause I got a best friend, now we need to meet at the box, no-oh
Now I'm really popping
Eight feet down, get it out then I'm city hoppin'
And even though not one teacher would catch me stoppin'
I gotta slow down, look around, and enjoy the small shit
So I'll be pickin' up when my mama calling
If you're wonderin', I prolly don't care about it

This is what I've discovered
I used to know my ethic
Now I'm bouncing off the walls of my intent
And I want everyone to know me
But I'm looking past required interaction
'Cause I've been looking down your path like a mental quickscope
Look in your direction realize that you wan' be friends though
Talking 'bout release dates, dominate my end goals
Yeah, I know I can do it, just gotta put in elbow (br-brakence)
Bad talk, good luck (Ay)
I'm lacking my funds (Ay)
Got no face on my passport
Got no haze in my lungs (Ay)
I just sit there and flashback
Fall backwards, I backtrack
Don't call me stupid, I'm dumb
Don't call me Cupid, 'cause, uh
Brakence made a brand new sound now
And if you hear it you won't wanna fuck with me
Worst handshake in the world
But when I show up they still wanna be stuck to me
'Cause I don't really care about the flux
Just your drive and your passion to do something that you love
Act up, yeah, I got it from the Wi-Fi
Everywhere I go want to see her in the night-time
Keep me up late, got me doing all the right crime
And running my ego right off a mattress
Think you're funny but really you stuck in past tense
I can get a little religious, no, I ain't static
Now I got a skill but how am I gonna cash this
You can keep it coming 'cause I'm gonna run it back
(brake-e-ence)
'Cause I've been looking down your path like a mental quickscope
Look in your direction realize that you wan' be friends though
Talking 'bout release dates, dominate my end goals
Yeah, I know I can do it just gotta put in elbow
I'm tired of these motherfuckers in my headphones
Loaded up with questions 'bout my mental state, Velcro
Booked weeks, like I really wanna keep up this show
Fuck everything but my DAW and my SO
And now I find myself enthralled
There's a reason I forgot what I was thinking, yeah
And I was trained to be responsible
But I can't do it with this screen in my lap
So I'll just be like
Get outta my Insta feed, why you wanna be a friend of me?
I'm a nerd, I don't care about one-night stands or drinking on the Hennessy
'Cause I'm on Earth to fight entropy, but I'm using chaos as my energy
Everywhere I need to go, add a little more just so I can feel myself
Get outta my Insta feed, why you wanna be a friend of me?
I'm a nerd, I don't care about one-night stands or drinking on the Hennessy
'Cause I'm on Earth to fight entropy, but I'm using chaos as my energy
Everywhere I need to go, add a little more just so I can feel myself, like
Get outta my Insta feed, why you wanna be a friend of me?
I'm a nerd, I don't care about one-night stands or drinking on the Hennessy
'Cause I'm on Earth to fight entropy, but I'm using chaos as my energy
Everywhere I need to go, add a little more just so I can—
Get outta my Insta feed, why you wanna be a friend of me?
I'm a nerd, I don't care about one-night stands or drinking on the Hennessy
'Cause I'm on Earth to fight entropy, but I'm using chaos as my energy
Everywhere I need to go, add a little more just so I can flex
Fuck

I'm dead
I cut you off (I'm dead)
But you can't find me
Fuck off with the basic (yeah)
In front like (I'm dead)
But you don't fuck me (I'm dead, dead)
I just wanna bang cause you're broken
Cause your heart, it's broken
Gotta hide but you're safe from it (I'm dead)
Just gonna bite off (I'm dead)
What you're sayin' now
And it's never (I'm dead)
Been that world outside
guy
I don't know, why are you telling lies? (I'm dead)
Wanna show when I'm cold as ice (I'm dead)
I cut you o-
But you can't fi-i-i-i
Can't find
Can't find me
Can't find me

Fuckboy tryna play my homie
But 2020, I'ma take time on me
Out the window where my mainline goes
This is sacrilegious how I'm gon' fade off IG (brakence)
Heartache comes in many forms
One day opens any door but
I've never seen this distant
What success? My eyes are on a screen
If you're hurting, call my line
And if you're doin' good, it's not like I don't care
I wanna see the world
This shit ain't the same if I can't breathe your air
Fuckboy tryna play my homie
But 2020, I'ma take time on me
Out the window where my mainline goes
This is sacrilegious how I'm gon' fade off IG (I can do everything)
Hope you find someone who can be invested
I'm not over you, that's not my objective
So obsessed with my mistakes, I gotta accept them
So I'm not gonna listen to him
He always wants a little more
Lost in his fake love and subliminals
Won't stay true if it's difficult
A lie's a lie, won't hide this shit to waste your time
And that's just bein' honest
Shouldn't fall in love and I shouldn't go to college
Gotta fight off all the pain he made in August
(I'm not who you think I am)
Fuckboy tryna play my homie
But 2020, I'ma take time on me
Out the window where my mainline goes
This is sacrilegion how I'm gon' fade on IG
I won't put no filler or no dud in my setlist
You should up your standards for what I can be impressed with
Out your metric
I'm alive and I need help
Hit concrete bottom
You could say I learned my lesson
Say I learned my les-learned my lesson-esson-esson
Say I learned my-say I learned my
Say I learned my lesson
My lesson, my lesson- Play my homie
But 2020- take time on me-take
Out the window-my mainline goes
This is so-sacrilegion- fa-a-a-a-i-i-i-g

And now I'm busy starin' at the ceiling
Thinking that you one in a million
I been in my own way for a minute
Wonder why I always pick myself to bill in
I just wish that you could take your time
You never deserve for me to say I'm fine
And all my new friends telling me to shoot myself
If I keep it inside, I'm gonna cure my love, yeah
I don't really wanna keep my distance
Call you over then I leak the difference
I been thinking that there's something missing
In the past tense, can't imagine
How I'm gonna be without you Wednesday
I ain't listening to what your friends say
There's no more moving, static
'Cause I'm scared of letting go
If I don't wanna see you naked
I'll take my time (I'll take my time)
I hate not to fall in line (Hate not to fall in line)
I know I'm wasted but I'll be fine (Wasted but I'll be fine)
'Cause something's gonna pay me with luck
I'm waiting it up, and then

(I don't wanna be that person)
(I don't wanna be that kind of person)
(Be that kinda person)
(Yeah, yeah)
Hmm, hmm, mm—
I wish I sounded like Frank Ocean
I dont, so I'll—,I'll just go with what I got
Hold that shit on replay, then told you
"I ain't got nothin' to lose," so I'm flipping over
I'm flipping over
Yeah
"Hold that shit for another day," you said, lookin' at me across the room
And I got more gas for the road than my opponents
So let it fall right through, yeah
If you weren't around, I'd probably stop making my decisions sober
But I still be all, and no matter when you call and only when you want me too
And I don't need first place, I could just hold you in person
I ain't fuckin' with the fakes, you know I know that for certain
We get in the momеnt, flirting with time, we're pacing it
So I don't need first placе, I could just hold you in person
I don't need first place, I could just hold you in person
I ain't fuckin' with the fakes, you know I know that for certain
We get in the moment, flirting with time, we're pacing it
So I don't need first place, I could just hold you in person, yeah
You're a tough guy, little bombshell
For the game, or put your
'Cause you only want what you know well
Well I think that I'm ready, or ready enough
Well if there ain't no watches, I'll tailor shit to a coffin
If you frame, I wonder, and lock it in a compartment
Show my words off, I mean in person
That's who we were once, get a little work done, when I'm gone
I'ma just stand my line, yeah
I ain't gonna break that trust, yeah
They ain't fuckin' with us
She waitin' for a day where you don't got nothin' to pray for
Go your way, you're made for
But i'ma get her on her feet, when I pray for her
Innovate, won't pay for her
Cause' this ain't neighbor, it's a grey war
I ain't in first place, I could just hold you in person
I ain't fuckin' with the fakes, you know I know that for certain
We get in the moment, flirting with time, we're pacing it
So I don't need first place, I could just hold you in person
I don't need first place, I could just hold you in person
I ain't fuckin' with the fakes, you know I know that for certain
We get in the moment, flirting with time, we're pacing it
So I don't need first place, I could just hold you in person, yeah

(brake-e-ence)
You know I think about it way too much
I just wanna feel my fate, like, I don't know how to touch you safely
(Your DJ has only just begun)
So what if you're not confident?
You feel that way to me, so don't look for more offerings
To bother you with how you're following a fuckin' part of you
If opposite, at least you got a starting point but it's hard to do
This is far from taking mainstage
I'll park the car away from over where the cane sprays
I need an argument for my obnoxious ways I shake state
To override my comfort zone, depart it and I'm on pace
But I don't need to race
Always say if you need some space
Be more safe if you open gates
I'll be waiting to do you favors
I swear this in my nature
My patience is open acres, I care if you're faking playfulness
And my lies all slowly faded so I cried and then I faced it
I don't even know my patience
I'm not clean
But I am not waste
I took his ego to the movies, that's a docked case
You know I think about it way too much
I just wanna feel my fate, like, I don't know how to touch you safely
This isn't pastime
I got more on my mind, they think I'm crazy
And I say, "Oh my God, oh my God, I am"
While I take you out of this place I hope I'm not phased
'Cause what you want makes me happy
What you want makes me happy
(Hahaha)

Ah
But baby, you don't understand
I don't want no other man
I spent all my serotonin on you
I did everything I can
Just to fuck it up again
I spent all my serotonin on you, ooh
Just say whatever you wanna say
A breakdown's wrapped around my face
Because I'm holdin' in the truth
And if I bite my tongue then maybe I won't cry
Had to hollow my lungs and let out a bad lie
I became such a fool, a husk, hallucinating
You don't understand
I don't want no other man
I spent all my serotonin on you
I did everything I can
And I fucked it up again
I spent all my serotonin on you, ooh
A hypochondriac (Stay up 'til five, pass out on the floor)
I think of you blood pressure spikes (I think too much, why can't I let you go?)
I'll have a heart attack (I'm on your side, fuck takin' offеnse)
The things I do to see you smile (But why do you act likе you were never my friend?)
You don't even gotta call me back (You can't forgive and I won't forget)
I just want some closure, little peace of mind (My whole Goddamn life, I was playin' pretend)
You don't even have to give me that (And now I can't get a word in)
Just sit down, listen to me because
You don't understand
I don't want no other man
I spent all my serotonin on you
I did everything I can
And I fucked it up again
I spent all my serotonin on you

Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you
By now, you shoulda somehow realised what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now
About you now
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how
I don't know how
Because maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

(Okay)
I hold onto patience for them
And reflect their mannerisms when I can't focus
Tired of selfish things I've said but never really spoken
I can't take back what I did when I forgot
So, I lack poise and, yeah, I noticed
But I drove it into the ground like it was poison
And I said I got a problem, will you show me?
But just because I need your help, don't mean it’s important
And now
(None of us knows, Major. We don't know who we are)
You know
(We don't know where we are)
(Maybe we're on a spaceship)
You know
(Going to another planet)
(Maybe we're all insane)
You know
(Or maybe this is a mirage, an illusion)
(Perhaps that's who we are)
Just know, I'm trying
But I faked you out on my end
And behind those shaded words
I partake in limbo, not violence
'Cause I'm just trying to feel like
More than my entry
I can't tell by deceit I'm alright and
It's 'bout time I show I've been lying
'Cause I can't wait back for it here
The only fear I'm in love with is pointless
I don't need luck, I need somebody's help for a minute
'Cause I've tried long enough
Pray I lost, I am done
Change my mind 'cause I'll be broken if there's nothing left to say
Just know I'm trying
But within a second it's timed in
(I've just never heard of them before)
Minding every word, and it's taking over afraid to love
But I will keep you around
You say I'm onto something, I doubt it
I find God in mind
Now I'm waking up and taking on my pride
(brakence)

The glass is on the floor
Don't wanna be opaque
That's my main goal and it ain't in my domain
I ain't really rocking with no grill or propane
Backing up is only honest when your god oppose fate
And if I wrote a song about it
It'd probably take a day or two, the power lane
'Cause you're the reason I'm okay
You're the reason (Yeah)
My ass can't park in the left end
You're an obvious blessing
Still, tarnish each second
With thoughts of your facial expression
Sidebar did I mention
I lost my intentions this weekend
They're wasted and I'ma fade out
Kinda complacent the way I indite my breakdown
Don't freestyle you a free-form feat
Doubt your resource, we all know you see short of that clear fact
But maybe it's not a thing that you can handle
But you should know you got me
And know I understand you
Showing up a commie
Abide by the law tell your dogs
Let 'em all know how you rebel
You ain't no mess 'cause
All of us slacking, that's a waterfall of lessons
A cornerstone of guessing
A preached agnostic message
You know this ain't automatic, you just practice
When I'm slacking, that's a waterfall of lessons
A cornerstone of guessing
A preached agnostic message
You know this ain't automatic, you just practice
Well, I'll confess I can't remember the last time I felt this exhausted
God knows I ain't jaded, though
Ego focused on the stats
Tell your friends I'm coming up
Like my fuckin' MPH on the dashboard the more I drive
I'm getting reckless but
But I just wish you could stay the night
Remember Cincinnati, shit was fire
5AM I saw a pretty sight
It's the small things that count most so don't hate your height
I still got friends in my cycle
5 days in 2 days out, my Bible
Can't change habits that's a working title
I been on a constant downward spiral
Like, I'm over my head I can't breathe
You're fine and way older than me
I ain't no freeloader
I'll keep more composure the closer I get to you
All of us slacking, that's a waterfall of lessons
A cornerstone of guessing
A preached agnostic message
You know this ain't automatic, you just practice
When I'm slacking, that's a waterfall of lessons
A cornerstone of guessing
A preached agnostic message
You know this ain't automatic, you just practice
Yeah, we're way too close to goodbye
And I feel like I ain't had the time to start
You can't ever be replaced
Known you since seventh grade
That's real shit, I live amazement
And I remember, as soon I got a moment with you I took it
Hoping you wouldn't ignore me
Laughing over songs we distorted
I was losing sleep over you, cutie
Every time you performed you would bleed and it moved me
And it's alright if you don't know what to say
Cause I can tell you what you're thinking looking at your face

This is an S.O.S. from the second of thirteen. We have entered an unknown stage of emotional development with our subject brakence. There is now a green light beaming from his forehead. We may have made a mistake getting him that iced americano. He hasn't been listening to our orders and is grinning with devious determination. We believe he may be scheming to shoot the sun. We arеn't pleased, to say the lеast. Shooting the sun is the highest risk, highest reward move in the game of hearts. If he doesn't pull back his bow far enough, the arrow will fail to reach its target and begin falling back down to earth. It will then reach him at terminal velocity and he will be impaled right between the eyes, which is exactly from where our precious truth energy emanates. However, he is so blindly confident in his ability to accomplish this that it might just work. But in that case, we have a whole new problem on our hands. We are urgently asking listeners to immediately delete any links or references to caffei—
How this shit ain't obvious to you? I'm not even twenty-one
My music be the snobbiest, somehow I'm still gon' get it done
And I ain't do this for the audience, hold me down, I already won
I know I'm dope as fuck, I guess I'm glowin'—

I haven't talked to you in months
But I thought that this might last
But you came and went so fast
And when I'm awake, I can't switch off
It isn't the same but it is enough
It isn't the same but it is enough
No-o-o, I tried babe
I can't fall asleep

Baby, don't be my crutch when this shit get gory
Got that radioactive touch, I'm from purgatory, she heard the story
I've been wearin' a demon, I've barely been eatin', I'm
Scrollin' all night, that's why I can't get to grieving
Baby, don't be my crutch when this shit get gory
Got that radioactive touch, I'm from purgatory, she heard the story
I've been wearin' a demon, I've barely been eatin', I'm
Scrollin' all night
Break it all down, like what does it mean to me? (Exclusive)
I got in this position so damn easily
Think I got good intentions, I got decency
But am I really a good person when I need to be? I need to bе
He put me on a pedеstal and liked nine tweets
I'm gettin' this tightness in my chest that make me grind my teeth
So I'ma just take another edible and go 5g
Old friends, they hate me now, I'm never gonna find my feet
Always puttin' myself above you to feel important
No, I'm never gon' take that dub, I can't be rewarded, go re-record it
I've been wearin' a demon, I've barely been eatin', I'm
Scrollin' all night, that's why I can't get to grieving
Baby, don't be my crutch when this shit get gory
Got that radioactive touch, I'm from purgatory, she heard the story
I've been wearin' a demon, I've barely been eatin', I'm
Scrollin' all night
Oh, don't be my crutch when this shit get gory
Got that radioactive touch, I'm from purgatory, I'm—
Nah, never gon' need your love, I can't feel supported
Got this feelin' in my gut, dread it every morning
Heat distortion, it's—
(Eyes on a phone)
Reason to get my head out of shit I regret
(Eyes on a phone)
Read me in overtime and it's nothing but net
(Eyes on a phone)
Yeah, feast on an open mind, I can't budget the feed
(Eyes on a phone)
They're farmin' our attention for a buck, like are you people?
(Eye, eye, eye)
They're using eyes like a resource
That's when I start to think we're fucked, there ain't no recourse
I profit off keystrokes, playin' into it, fillin' my plate
Unstoppable heat source, burnin' off any minute I take it
And when I die, I hope I'm buried in a forest
That is if any of it's left, this shit is torrid
For now, I'm using up my gift to write a chorus
Always puttin' myself above you to feel important
No, I'm never gon' take that dub, I can't be rewarded, go re-record it
I've been wearin' a demon, I've barely been eatin', I'm
Scrollin' all night (Ahh)
Baby, don't be my crutch when this shit get gory
Got that radioactive touch, I'm from purgatory, she heard the story
I've been wearin' a demon, I've barely been eatin', I'm
Scrollin' all night, that's why I can't get to grieving (Break it all down, like what does it mean?)
They're layin' waste to a new biome
To make a case for the new iPhone
The waters laced and they know I know
Wearin' a demon, I can't get to grieving, I—
(Hollywood) Can't get to grieving, I
Gotta repeat it, I (Just give up)
(Hollow) Too busy dreaming (Just give up)
Part of my (No), that's why I can't (Just—), that's why
A hypochondriac, I think of you, blood pressure spikes
I'll have a heart attack, the things I do—

Wait
They tell me I'm way too manic
Too busy stannin' BROCKHAMPTON and killin' choruses
I don't needa retort
You should consider uppin' your standards
Or grab your stolen romantic
You can't compare what's present to what's in store
Play this record as frequently as—
(Mmm)
Okay, it's happening, everybody stay calm
Yeah
What's the procedure everyone? What's the procedure?
Stay ****ing calm
(br-br-brakence)
I'm-I'm done askin' when the pain gonna stop
All these first impressions got me too afraid to talk, yeah
So I'ma say just what I thought
There is no expression on the face of God
You are listening to a child at play
And please don't lay me in your box
Coffins make me lazy and in hell I wanna spark, yeah
Don't wanna wake up in the dark
There is no expression on the face of G—
If you ever catch on fire you should stop, drop, and roll
Whoa, on your spine like a little cousin
But take my sweet time when I spit a dozen, yeah
People ask if this my prime
Peek a couple doors right, on sight, only will be stuntin'
Uh, I just gotta put my mind to somethin'
Pretend I practice on the dollar, but you know I’m bluffin'
Money is time, but who needs to pay
When a divine four minutes and 59 gonna save me
Weight fades, that's a moral slate
Need your mother remotivatin' with cordial hate
Ain't no story, cater to the allegory
Like a hero's ballad with nothin' but a belated date
Zero status with a bullcat bureau
I'm on that full cap quiero
I spiraled down to pose here and say
If I'ma get it, no Novocaine
Better bring the gang wit' me, I'm a sober man, yeah
Whoa, well, I can't take my time
But it's been confusin' tryna make up my mind
Is this illusion tryna live in your eyes?
In your eyes (Whoa)
Uh
But lived through it when my voice arose
The path is littered with hurdles taller than coffee
I avoided loads of problems in that skinny body
But my purpose is more than callin' my fault
Write in homage
That's a whole lot
God knows, I promise I'm gon' grow from the hate
Yeah, I feel the love when it goes away
While you're too golden to care about our decay
Wait
They tell me I'm way too manic
Too busy stannin' BROCKHAMPTON and killin' choruses
I don't needa retort
You should consider uppin' your standards
Or grab your stolen romantic
You can't compare what's present to what's in store
And it's automatic
I gotta have it, ain't so static
I'm foreshadowin', it's about to happen
You mad 'cause I got the advantage no shock tactics
Make reckless abandon a torch against dogmatics, and
I'm-I'm done askin' when the pain gonna stop
All these first impressions got me too afraid to talk, yeah
So I'ma say just what I thought
There is no expression on the face of God
And please don't lay me in your box
Coffins make me lazy and in hell, I wanna spark
Yeah, don't wanna wake up in the dark
There is no expression on the face of—
I'm done askin' when the pain gonna stop
All these first impressions got me too afraid to talk
Yeah, so I'ma say just what I thought
There is no expression on the face of God
And please don't lay me in your box
Coffins make me lazy and in hell, I wanna spark
Won't wanna wake up in the dark
There is no expression on the face of God

I can't wait no longer
Would you say something?
I can't wait no longer (brakence)
D-D-Dropped out, I was seventeen
Wasting all my money, mixing dope and LSD
Man, mama said, "Don't get ahead of me"
But I don't wanna finish college, I got hella dreams
Well, I don't know what's gotten into me
Ever since I stopped pretending, it was history
Dropped out, I was seventeen
Now I've got more freedom than I've ever seen
Life don't have directions
And I been tryin' to quarantine
The thought of Heaven in the meantime
I've realized I've been there before
All the doors are closed, wanted so much more
Now it's nice to know there's no enemy
Or a victory
It's all costumes, funny dances to—
I can do everything
Dropped out, I was seventeen
Wasting all my money, mixing dope and LSD
Man, mama said, "Don't get ahead of me"
But I don't wanna finish college, I got hella dreams
Well, I don't know what's gotten into me
Ever since I stopped pretending, it was history
Dropped out, I was seventeen
Now I've got more freedom than I've ever seen
(What other effects?) I-I-I love my mama
Don't wan' be apart, man
My brothers say just go get an apartment
Flipping the pages to get into the garden
By now the mara taller, treat me like a God, damn
Feelings rolled up and it's 'bout time
Exhale in the ninth cloud, cloud nine
I got money, I'll expand on it
Cancel your plans, authority couldn't handle us
Okay, this the type shit that make my hands fall asleep
Low blood sugar and some more caffeine
I don't need loving, but I want that cheap
So much luck that I've laughed to pieces
Looked inside for some consolation
I found a bi-dime in his prime, embraced it, I
Learned it was never complicated
You are who you are, don't keep you waiting
I said you are who you are, don't keep you waiting
(I can't wait no longer) I said you
(Won't you say something)
I said you are who you are, man (I can't wait no longer)
Dropped out, I was seventeen
Wasting all my money, buying 1P-LSD
Mama said, "Don't get ahead of me"
But I don't wanna finish college, I got hella dreams
I don't know what's gotten into me
Ever since I stopped pretending, it was history
Dropped out, I was seventeen
Now I've got more freedom than I've ever seen
(brakence)
He was only in town for like, a month, and we've been friends for like—

I'd like to find the word because I can ordinarily find them, but it seems to me that... uh...
I can't seem to want to say what I was going to say
Kind to the floor when I walk
I'm just taking all my time
I'm so original
I just don't wanna fuck up
It's not intended to get her attention in my head
The last time that I ever looked up was the time I told her she was beautiful
I'm fucked up, buzzing
And I might as well buy myself an ego check from the neurotic fever I just failed to let go
I don't care so much about my social responses
When I feel this good the future doesn't fucking matter
And I'm laying, rest, when I stay up myself till one then I fade
Then I fade
I give myself a headache, I'm gonna show up late
I'm trying to give it time, but I'm falling for the preface
It's not blank
I'm trying to tell her how I think
I need faith
In what pride I have
And to exchange my witnesses
'Cause I don't know them now
But I will
After I fall apart
And I can't see it
'Cause I'm not equipped
It's almost like the... the singing of-of angels or something
I think it's the... soundtrack or the film going through the...
The machine

Slow down, breathe
Slow down, breathe
What's in the ground beneath your feet?
Get off that screen and let it go
A blue check screams
I always whisper what you want
And it was right here all along
'Cause I found something with a taste you can't describe
You take it in and all your roots get intertwined
And every time
I call you back, I know you're fine
I know you're fine
There's no cancer in the water
It's not an answer or a dream
Your mother and your father
Would rather blow it all on ginger tea
More to offer than a feed, breathe
And you're ready for it
I think it's for the best you leave this town
You're ready for this, now
Breathe
Slow down, breathe
Terrified when I'm 'bouta be brave
Since Danny hit me, I've been killin' the game
Power to you if you're ridin' the wave
Couldn't give a fuck 'bout no money or fame
Take you and your girl right back to my place
'Cause man or woman, I'ma fuck you the same
Picking me up when she back in my state
A quick flight to NYC for some cake
Touchdown, 50 came in the clutch
My boy's bound for somethin' bigger than us
Cuts deep like a knife, that's the shit you can feel
My mama love me and her willpower steel
Anxious heart 'bouta beat out my chest
I'm sorry 'bout me and I wish you the best
I just wanna fuck, the marijuana get me scared of trauma
But I'm gon' be okay, good sex every day
Great sex like the greatest is fate
Load my plate with acid, salad, and breaks
I get drunk and she gets stupid high
I just chill 'cause I don't wanna try
When I don't know what the fuck to say
I don't know what the fuck to say
I don't know what the fuck to say

Bloomtodeath
Learned, tryna find myself
It ain't gotta be a one-way fight
But every single time I ask for help
They just talk right over me, assume I'm fine
Now I'm closing every open door
Bent teeth and it's all my fault
I lose grip, wasting all this soul
I'm falling apart
'Cause no one cares for me, except me
I'm chilling by death, CBD
Baby, was something I said too extreme?
Now while you dying to reach me, I don't care
'Cause no one cares for me, excеpt me
I'm chilling by death, CBD
Baby, was something I said too еxtreme?
Now while you dying to reach me, I don't care
'Cause no one cares for me
I just really wish I warned myself (Run)
That because my momma raised me right
I would have to kick you off the shelf
You motherfuckers was a waste of time
Clock's ticking, why would I ever listen?
I don't need supervision, I'm balling with no provisions
I'ma be a musician, I'ma fuck up my life
And that's why no one cares for me, except me
I'm chilling by death, CBD
Baby, was something I said too extreme?
Now while you dying to reach me, I don't care
'Cause no one cares for me, except me
I'm chilling by death, CBD
Baby, was something I said too extreme?
Now while you dying to reach me, I don't care
'Cause no one cares for me

Now everybody plug in where they mouth is
And it burned while all my thoughts are clouded
I was shocked by the shit that I shouted
And so I came along in some pigtails
And  on a
waste my time
I don't wanna play you
Haulin' heartache through Friday
And you can rob me a bank
You punch me right in the face
Run me over and break me
And I'll thank you for it
I never wanted this shit
Take all my money away
Just throw me in the ditch
And I'll thank you from the grave
I can't focus
It's like magic and I found a black lotus
Thinking bout us tangling in my bedsheets
Shaking in them ripped jeans
Hoping that you notice, do you?
Do you wanna be my bestie?
Fuck no, cause I'm only getting wet feet
Uh, down low when you sext me
You say lately I've been working on my type beat
And you can rob me a bank
You punch me right in the face
Run me over and break me
And I'll thank you for it
I never wanted this shit
Take all my money away
Just throw me in the ditch
And I'll thank you from the gra-a-ve
It was so nice to see you
They say that looks can be quite deceitful
But I admire your evil
Baby, could you crush me like a beetle
Like a fly
I just wanna die and come back to life
I don't wanna try just to say i tried
But what I-I
I'm
I'm so done with taking advice
It's my fault, I'm on my own
It's never me
It's all my fault
I'm
Is it worth it?
I'm
And on my own
These motherfuckers waste my time
I don't know where to go

(brakence)
I'd fuck up my life if you told me to
But I don’t need your help
I do it by myself
Maybe a lie is a second truth
But I can never tell (Ooh)
So we can't do this my way
Suck up all my time for the moment
Drowning in my fault and I know it isn't healthy
But can anybody sell me for this art
I don’t wanna spend time with you, nah
You don't fucking know me bro, just tell me what you got, uh
Before I claim your spot
Still, you're stuck in my favor
It's all the same
You got my attention, but I won't listen
Can't walk with conviction
Been out of state
So how come I'm burnin' out
Tryna make it out of here alive?
I want more from men and women
If we take it slow then I won’t hesitate, yeah
We could do it thirty minutes
And you can ask me any second of the day
I’m gon' miss you, but I’ll never hit the brakes
'Cause I'm fucking or I'm fucked up in my head
And if I ain’t gonna sing that shit you better see me
Work a nine-to-five to fill my plate
So you best watch me pop
When people get the gist, they be like "Oh my God," yeah
I got more time off
Still tryna figure out who you are
Can't put my thoughts to speech unless I steal your magic and I put you on my sleeve
All I really know is I should punch the snare in when I'm feeling beat
And I'd fuck up my life if you told me to
But I don't need your help
I do it by myself, oh
Maybe a lie is a second truth
But that shit don't go well
Nah, that shit don't go well
Yeah
I suck up all my time for the moment
Drowning in my fault and I know it isn't healthy
But can anybody sell me for this art
I don't wanna leave home
Can't free smoke and it's all my fault, baby
But it's alright just know I feel you
I feel you
This ain't all my love
I got way more love
This ain't all love
I got way more love
This ain't all my love
I got way more love
This ain't all, love
I got more love

I backtrack on normalizing phrases
It’s more important when the green is gone
She feels the same way
I like to think it means exactly what it is
But it’s probably a social kind of thing
I don’t think I’ve ever known one higher
If you drop hints I’m okay with that
Is this another distraction?
I’ve had more than one before
Is it my fault that I’m calling it beforehand?
'Cause you keep accepting his presence and I don’t know why I forget every time
I don’t want to mistake this for the LED lying and
I know enough not to hypothesize, but I can’t tell
I don’t think I have a chance to read you
While you sit and get your sight
And hearing overloaded
I want all five, but this is my crutch

And the fear about bringing up something else—
(brakence)
Hello?
Hey
I think too much
At least I know that (Hey)
And I say too much
I'm gonna go back
'Cause I have found myself in you
(Hello?)
And I need your love
As much as I need, (Hey) air in my lungs
And I'll be waiting 'cause I have yet to show you, girl
And I'll feel better when
We've stared and maybe talked it out with all my effort
I'm learning now
And I'll be exactly what you want
Once I straighten myself out
In the meantime, I'll be down to try and help
Help
But I think too much
At least I know that (Hey)
And I weigh too much
But I'll relax
'Cause I have found a little truth in you
(Hello?)
And I need your love
As much as I need air in my lungs
And I'll be floating 'cause I have let my worry go
I think too much
And I say too much
I'm gonna go back
'Cause I have found myself in you
Umm, my rationalizing right now this minute, and I don't know how to do that except to shut up and, umm

Saw you on stage in the morning
If  you look at my eyes
You  couldn't tell nothin' 'bout what happened before ya'
I knew a lie when I told it
And even if you're good guy, all California
I  ain't, I ain't unfoldin'
While  in the broad day takin' advice
I just can't seem to report it
Ooh,  and I get money at the peak of my vices (Yeah)
Just gotta bend my knees
All the people sayin' I ain't got issues (Yeah)
Well, your girlfriend can't lie like me
And  I can't seem to answer my own questions with this time (Yeah)
'Cause somewhere far ahead, I go fallin' far behind
It won't be Heaven when I leave here
I get to movin' cause I'm fine
You know I never wanna be him
So why the fuck's he on my mind?
I'm gonna find another reason
And I'll be puttin' up a fight
And if my eyes are ever speakin'
I'm gonna hide it, boy won't cry, yeah
You were the mindful kind of gorgeous (Yeah)
If I looked in your eyes
I couldn't tell nothing about what happened before this (Yeah)
You knew the lie when I told you
And even if a good guy wanna explore it (Yeah)
I just, I just can't afford to
While in the broad day takin' advice (Yeah)
I just can't seem to consort you
It's just in my—
No, I've been waiting to let you know that I (Yeah)
Wanna hit your telephone, 'cause I
Know you're out in Yellowstone, but (Yeah)
You make me wanna forget that I am made of you (Yeah)
Sittin' in the back thought, "This is what I want"
"It's what I want" (Yeah)
Oh, I was dead wrong, now I got nothin'
And I just can't think about who I'm crushin'
I was dead wrong and I can't fix dead air
Shit too far away, should've stopped fightin' to care
I was dead wrong, weak shit, mind my business
I'm just tryna to make what I love a livin'
I lost hope, fuck boys thought me a ceilin'
Too insecure to let them know how I was feeling
It won't be— fuck, mmm
It won't be Heaven when he's leavin'
I get to movin' 'cause I'm fine
You know I never wanna be here
So why the fuck's he on my mind?
I'm gonna find another reason
And I'll be puttin' up a fight
And if my eyes are ever leakin'
I'm gonna hide it, boy won't cry
It won't be heaven when he's leavin'
I get to movin' 'cause I'm fine
You know I never want to be here
So why the fuck's he on my mind?
I'm gonna find another reason
And I'll be puttin' up a fight
And if my eyes are ever leakin'
I'm gonna hide it, boy won't cry, yeah
You can't sell this man, you got—

A hypochondriac
I think of you, blood pressure spikes
I'll have a heart attack (I'm using my imagination)
I take it better when she don't even ask me
Three chords, and she all over me nasty
She got me smothered, caught me buggin' her last week
Leave a scar on my soul 'cause it's smarter to fold
I take it better when she don't even ask me
Three chords, and she all over me nasty
She got me smothered, caught me bugging hеr last week
Leave a scar on my soul 'cause it's smartеr to fold
I take it better when she don't even ask—
'Cause I'm laced with poison, I can't escape the rush
This ain't love, boy, you're just a pick-me-up
And the gaze Medusa, locks rattlesnakes, debuffed
No need to purchase my soul, girl, I'll just give it up
I'm like "God damn," she slid in, now we're breaking the ice
The concoction just hit me, it's dilating my eyes
Fuck my options, she pulled me in, she didn't even try
I was hypnotized soon as her lips met mine, I can't forget
I take it better when she don't even ask me
Three chords, and she all over me nasty
She got me smothered, caught me buggin' her last week
Leave a scar on my soul 'cause it's smarter to fold
I take it better when she don't even ask me
My corpse is spillin' blood in the backseat
She's undercover, got a Trojan to crash me
Leave a scar on my soul, seein' stars in the road
I take it better when she don't even ask me
She got this on repeat
I'm obsessive as her, she obsessive as me (Yeah)
Laments turn me to stone, and her curves got me weak
She wan' get us alone, I can tell she a freak
It be like, oh no, she invited me to a pity party
But go home and hope you ain't leavin' with nobody
But fate sewn, she'll take me back to her place
Can't say this shit to her face or make up my mind, I can't forget
A hypochondriac
I think of you, blood pressure spikes
I'll have a heart attack
The things I do to see you smile
Yeah, I know I made my art entertainment
Carbon to coal, now my card can't decline and it costs my control
I'll let God integrate, but until then I gotta give in to you, oh-oh
I take it better when she don't even ask me
Three chords, and she all over me nasty
She got me smothered, caught me buggin' her last week
Leave a scar on my soul 'cause it's smarter to fold
I take it better when she don't even ask me
Three chords, and she all over me nasty
(Stop crying on the dance floor)
She got me smothered, caught me buggin' her last week
(Shit rhyme, I had no plan for it)
Leave a scar on my soul 'cause it's smarter to fold
(I'm on top the c—)
I take it better when she don't even ask me
(I'm on top the c—)
My corpse is spillin' blood in the backseat
(Stop crying on the dance floor)
She's undercover, got a Trojan to crash me
(I'm on top the c—)
Leave a scar on my soul, seein' stars in the road
(I'm on top the c—)
I take it better when she don't even ask
Don't even ask (Fall deep)
Then we vaporized 'til our fates aligned
I think we frayed the twine
Tethering space and time, I can't forget
Into this trance
Your mind is programmed to drift on these words
Use my voice in your head as a thread to your heart
All that pain you're carrying, all that regret (She knows)
I can remove it, all you have to do is let me (She grows, she grows)
She grows through my throat and my chest
My tears were glowing just to muffle the screaming out
(Only remember you love me) Hi-Fi
Stuck in amber and honey
My headache split wide awake
I'll hide the pain for you
Yeah, yeah, oh
Yeah, yeah, no (No)
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh, no, no, no, no (You left me nauseous)

(brakence)
We keep doubling our words and this doubling is comparable to Oscillation
When you get to think that you think your thoughts
The you standing aside the thoughts has the same sort of consequence of seeing double
I am worried and I ought not to worry, but because I can’t stop worrying, I am worried because I worry and that is what we call anxiety, trembling
Yeah, I know for a fact that it's my fault
I know for a fact that I'll resolve
Somebody take me away from (Haha)
'Cause I know for a fact that it's my fault
And I'm trying to live with a result
Yeah, I know for a fact that it's my fault
Yeah
I will do my best to overcome when winter's no more
And I know, well, I'd never be this far without my mother
At least my older will, will take me places I need to go
But I don't care unless you come along, I need you over
I need you over

I can hear it now through everything you say
My time is up, I have to take myself away
And erase myself from all of my mistakes
If I'm too scared to, let me know
And I won't change 'cause I'm for nothing
I can't keep on moving on
Won't take a second chance again
'Cause all I do is tear more thoughts from your head
This should be simple on my end
End it now and you'll be set, you understand
And I owe this my life
I found hope in sound, I thought I couldn't write
And just because I'm letting out my patient side
Don't mean I got this
But I'll let you know when I'm alone

So, can you give me a call? The silence is haunting
We've weathered the storm, we've been through it all, and
Now, I think I'm missing part of the story
Was it something I said?
'Cause baby, I need to know
There's no controlling the motion, the left and right
You pull me closer, then push away right on time
Your eyes are raining, the pain brought us two steps back
I wanna understand, so tell me what I—
Did wrong
All I ever wanted was you for so long, let's find a way
You got no clue, so much better off with you
I'm the one, now let me prove it, baby
Just tell me what I did wrong
Say you lost my love, you're dead wrong
You know I've been here all along
Can't you see you mean everything to me?
And now we're falling to pieces
Baby, you got it dead wrong
Nonsense, you know i'm keepin' my promise
If you ever need anything, then I'm right outside at your doorstep
Can't get you off my mind, you know I'll show you every time
We're meant to be together, but now I'm so alone
And I'm calling out your name
Cause nothing feels the same
Am I the one to blame?
I wanna understand, so tell me what I—
Did wrong
All I ever wanted was you for so long, let's find a way
You got no clue, so much better off with you
I'm the one, now let me prove it, baby
Just tell me what I did wrong
Say you lost my love, you're dead wrong
You know I've been here all along
Can't you see you mean everything to me?
And now we're falling to pieces
Baby, you got it dead wrong
And I'm callin' out your name
To patch things up, and with some luck
We might just find a way
Just tell me what I—
Did wrong
All I ever wanted was you for so long, let's find a way
You got no clue, so much better off with you
I'm the one, now let me prove it, baby
Just tell me what I did wrong
Say you lost my love, you're dead wrong
You know I've been here all along
Can't you see you mean everything to me?
And now we're falling to pieces
Baby, you got it dead wrong

'Cause, 'cause what I was breaking
Was something to save me now
My heart, it hit your spot
What you wanna do, console me?
I love you but I had to get my own feet
Now I get what I get, like holy moly
There's a goal and he's terrified to show me, yeah
I could work that out, you wouldn't know me
It was all I had 'cause I was nosy
It was all I had 'cause I was nosy
Was stupid, posing for
Yeah, it's still better than my-
Wrapped in the skin
Of the American dream forever
If you live it, then you owe me
It'd probably kill you just to tell a different story
You splatter the rain with scars circling your head
And now the wound is getting mouldy
You say you do but the position's getting cozy
It's nosy, I know me
I might fall in love, I got no weed
What you wanna do for
dad and call him
Will you want it back when you call him?
What you wanna do?
What you wanna do?
I'm afraid to ask you
I'm afraid to ask you how you're doin'
I'm afraid to ask you how you're doin'
I'm afraid to ask you how you're doin'
I'm afraid to ask you how you're doin'
What-
Sink your teeth in this bitch
I'ma smoke some coral reef in this bitch
Spill the oil all on to the beast, flick the switch
So rich like I cackle, I reach in my satchel and
Pull out a castle, it's
water ()
I can't give a fuck who does wanna
Thinkin', oh my god, I gotta  my girl
Of the American dream forever
If you live it, then you owe me
It'd probably kill you just to tell a different story
You splatter the rain with scars circling your head
And now the wound is getting mouldy
You say you do but the position's getting cozy
It's nosy, I-

If I ever got to leave here by success
I wouldn't wait for you
I’d rather keep our thoughts in checkmate
And I've been hurting tryna pull this out my chest
Is there another way to say that I won't talk to you again?
I won’t talk to you again
'Cause I ain't doing favors, maybe confounded
Couldn't give a fuck about it
I ain't doing favors, on the way get grounded
Stable like mountain
Fake your nature, say you changed but I doubt it
Put your money where your mouth is
I ain't doing favors, if longevity is out there
Need amenity, you—
I ain't doing favors, maybe confounded
Couldn't give a fuck about it
I ain’t doing favors, on the way get grounded
Stable like mountain
Fake your nature, say you changed but I doubt it
Put your money where your mouth is
I ain’t doing favors, if longevity is out there
Need amenity, you out there
Just feel no info
You should give me my respect
You ain't know what you’re in for
Not pretty at best
My thought's in limbo
No law, no intro
If you're talking 'bout the credo
Know I’m coming for the neck
I-I don't wanna be provocative
I just ain't tryna breathe your oxygen
Why you going round startin' shit?
I've found that need no argument
You committed cardinal sin
Knees weak, no sleep, we gon' drift apart
Just mark in it, ain't no meager feat
But fuck off, tryna politic
And chase my goals, I can't date it back
I don't wait for shit, I ain't made for that
We got the same flow, whoa, where'd it go?
Need to change clothes, still blow it up like a staple fact, and I'm gone
Then spend all my luck on Twitter
Know me, found I ain't the same in winter
But this a marathon and all these fuckboys sprinters
Gonna paint a moral high ground, that's a painkiller
You can feed me lies if you're compelled
I'ma be frank for my health
My sweetheart handsome as well
'Cause I see both sides like Chanel
This an artist's ocean, my blueprint
Say that you ain't bugging, you lucid
Ain't it funny how you can't prove it?
Who do I always see running back?
I ain't doing favors, maybe confounded
Couldn't give a fuck about it
I ain't doing favors, on the way get grounded
Stable like mountain
Fake your nature, say you changed but I doubt it
Put your money where your mouth is
I ain't doing favors, if longevity is out there
Need amenity, you out here
I ain't doing favors, maybe confounded
Couldn't give a fuck about it
I ain't doing favors, on the way get grounded
Stable like mountain
Fake your nature, say you changed but I doubt it
Put your money where your mouth is
I ain't doing favors, if longevity is out there
I need amenity, you out here
Fuck you, you too basic for a maybe
You lucky if you waitlisted, I'm lazy
I'm stuck on a few pages in a daydream
No one's gonna be able to save me
These days self-hatred is motivation
Spreads outside me and I'm running out patience
Let you lie but cut you out the equation
Never liable, when bluffing I never say shit
Where'd the mood go? Flip the beat like judo
You got that fools gold, say you don't you do though
On my feet, uh, ain't no mass appeal, uh
Pity a leader, wouldn't wanna be you
And I've been waiting way too long to be free from ya'
Free from ya'
I'll remember this up out the top of my head
No etiquette 'cause I won't edit with the thought of a threat
Make your bets, this ain't Reddit, won't argue on in no thread
It's art, taking shots in the dark, beat already dead
Couldn't give less of a fuck what you say
'Cause I'm a gifted mess and I'm stuck in my ways
Everybody want a feature, I won't ask for no pay
A teacher by night, preacher by day, but don't actually pray
I'm that kinda fake, I hold that kinda weight
Float leave a passionate wake
I ain't burning no rubber
I'm back in action, been averting stunners since day one
I'll curve a sucker 'cause they too basic like A1
And it hurts to say this but don't call my line
I've been done with you since autumn, you ain't worth my time
The fuck does it take get out the Matrix and learn your lie?
I thought you knew the first time

Fuck
Think I'm dreaming
This isn't real
'Cause you leave in a month
And I'm fiending for something to feel
When you hold me
Know you know me down to my core
This is the calm before the storm
You diverted attention away when I mentioned
That someone else gon' need you more
Now there's too many people that I have done wrong
And that I owe my thanks to for sticking along with me
Along with me, oh, oh
And I fell apart in that bed
What we built isn't me
Won't put it back together again
I can't take back what I said
I just look through those messages I left on read
And I took you to Rosier ‘cause I thought we could cope
We got out on the ocean, I fell out my boat
And you calmed me back down
And you gave me some hope
And I tossed that away for a seratone
Now there's too many people that I have done wrong
And that I owe my thanks to for sticking along with me
Along with me, oh, oh
No commitments, no
No commitments, no commitments, no commitments
No commitments, no commitments, no commitments
I'm going to Hell, you're going to Heaven
It doesn't negate our holy connection
And next time I fly too close to the sun
I'm not gonna run, this shit was for fun
I left home now I'm fucked up
Realized how much I loved you
Whole goddamn life, been a suck-up
Now I'm just tryna get my luck up
All the pain went when you kissed me
We were ten toes up, now I'm six feet down
Moved on, you don't need me now
Now I gotta figure me out
Ah
Oh, I gotta figure me out, oh-oh, yeah, uh
Bitch, I'm up next
Fuckboy ain't a threat
Put a price on my head
Won't sell my soul for a check
That's on God, that's on sound
You won't ever see me 'round
I'll be cookin' up some shit that's gonna get me out this town

So can you fuck off? I don't need your hand
You thought it was love, baby
I was just playin' so
Good luck with your next boyfriend
'Cause I don't want a girl, I ain't even want a ma—
(bloomtodeath)
I was tryna make a living
Well I did, and now I don't wanna live at all
And you wonder why I'm distant
My only friend is whatever I was trippin' off
Yeah, but you would never get it
You turned my personality into some kind of fetish
You think it's all copacetic
I hit your pen and then I lost it
Ever since then, I've been manic and exhausted
Think I wanna die and I can't keep my mind off it
Twenty-four-seven headache and I'm always nauseous
Cut my losses, 'cause I can never tеll if it's somethin' I really wanted
Would you fuck off?
I don't need your hand
You thought it was lovе, baby
I was just playin' so
Good luck with your next boyfriend
'Cause I don't want a girl, I ain't even want a man
I just, I just wanna be dead (Don't be that brash)
I just, I just wanna be dead (Like)
Yeah, I just wanna be dead (Real fr— Wake the fuck up)
I just, I just wanna be dead (Who you really call— Real fr)
Run away from me, baby, block my cell
Judgment Day is comin', I'ma rot in hell and
I'm too fuckin' cowardly to off myself
All the talk don't help, you just not gon—
Okay, I started all this shit as an outlet
Now everybody plug in where they mouth is
So I burned out, all my thoughts were clouded
I was shocked by the shit that I shouted
And an old friend told me that I sold out
So I laughed and said, "All I wear is argyle"
'Cause you'd think that maybe I'd set the bar too high
When I'm strugglin' to find a way to waste my time
Just fuck off, I don't need your hand
You thought it was love, baby
I was just playin' so
Good luck with your next boyfriend
'Cause I don't want a girl, I ain't even want a man
I just, I just wanna be dead (Fuck)
I just wanna be dead
I just, I just wanna be dead
I just wanna be dead

I've been tryin' to breathe (uh)
Stayin' up past five, grindin' my teeth (mm)
I just wanted to be everything and more
But for the wrong reasons (uh)
No-no-now it's overwhelmin'
Got all I want, I'm still gettin' jealous
Well then, off that pack
Feelin' like a felon
Bullet up my dome, feelin' like Selman's
Fuckin' hell, man
I wanna know why I'm so insecure
I can't control it
I thought I'd already closed that door
I wanna fix my teeth
You say I cover up my lisp when I speak
I know you don't like-
I know you don't like me
So fuck me up and lie some more
I don't know why I can't sleep
Lurk 'til the birds chirp, sigh and repeat
Should practice what I preach
There's no way they're supposed to perceive me
And I ain't know but it's easier said than done
I wanna go way back to when I was young
When before they left all the peace
Evoke one last sigh, wanna check up on my feed but
I wanna know why I'm so insecu-u-u-ure
I can't control it
I thought that I'd already closed that door
I wanna fix my teeth
You say I cover up my lisp when I speak
I know you don't like-
I know you don't like me
So fuck me up and lie some more
O-o-o-o-ore
O-o-o-o-ore
My-my-my lungs are caving
Spent eight weeks tweaking in the basement
Found a problem in her statement
Do I trust her when she say she wanna get acquainted?
She say she wanna be my best friend
Bu-but I can't hang around no yes-men
Shovel fake love out the hole that I stepped in
N-no time, I already lost my adolescence
You think you're better than me?
But offline, you're nowhere to be seen
You think I'm lying that I'm lettin' you breathe?
Hangin' off your banister by my crooked teeth

I'm never gon' let you down again
Fucked you good as I imagine
Said, nothing changed but I doubt it
Wouldn't leave you in the past tense
I'm never gon' let you—
(Ghost for a whole week)
Thought I really want your love but you don't know me
Text you all damn night, hour unholy
I couldn't get a second of sleep when I found out you were just my type
I was dead wrong but it felt so right
When you caught my gaze with those dark green eyes
And I'm never gon' change thinking 'bout that twice
It's all chord changes and vocal lines
I'm a mess and it looks like you got your shit together
But despite all of my first impressions
I can't imagine what's gonna happen
Get your ass back here
I'm never gon' let you down again
Fucked you good as I imagine
Said, nothing changed but I doubt it
Wouldn't leave you in the past tense
I'm never gon' let you down again
Fucked you good as I imagine
Said, nothing changed but I doubt it
Wouldn't leave you in the past tense
I'm never gon' let you—
I swore that I was fed up
How could I turn it back?
You got tied by the words I choked on
And the qualities I lack (He didn't answer me)
What is it I run from?
Deny it was best
The rest is left up to the somethings that exist outside my head
Now we've got a wedding for a whole week
Hold each other, remember the thing you told me
Now there's only minutes until this plane leaves
But, wait, did I just leave heaven or is it waitin' there?
I'm never gon' let you down again
I'll fuck you good as I imagine
Said, nothing changed but I doubt it
Wouldn't leave you in the past tense
I'm never gon' let you down again
Can't get you out of my head
Said, nothing changed but I doubt it
Wouldn't leave you in the past tense
I'm never gon' let you—
If all is lost
I've got the peace in my mind
You'll probably be fine
I was scared of what you'd say
But since I've made some more mistakes—
(I'm never gon' let you—)
I've done some wrong things in the past, but that's okay

I got my issue, but can't find it
Had to wait for the winding
And the letting go, woah
Now I got leads inside my stomach
And I don't need 'em for nothing
But I'ma let 'em grow, woah
You know I've been caught up in my lie
It's never for the worst
I was never fighting for my flight
It was something for the floor
Say she can't afford to pend my life
So call me to accord
You know I've been caught up in my lie
Heaven was the curse (Is it a telephone?)
And I can't be myself unkindly
So I won't be treadin' lightly
My legs are gon' be sore
But I'll be ready for it
And people act like uprooting gon' distract a kid
Ain't gon' change for my better if I'm this adamant
And anywhere I go, there's always an out of here
Like I don't know no better for myself, baby
(We all felt the same)
You know I've been caught up in my lie
It's never for the worst
I was never fighting for my flight
It was something for the floor
Say she can't afford to pend my life
So call me to accord
You know I've been caught up in my lie
Heaven was the curse
I got two suns outside and I know I'm gonna miss you, yeah
'Cause what's more childish than waitin' for the time we can misuse?
The love is nasty
The trees attacked me
The terra whacked me
I don't need nobody
I can't commit the divided
(Use this in times of need or when)
But I got them waiting for sure
(Tough guys up in your feed)
I just wanna let it go
(I get uptight when limits pass)
I gotta
(But that's what I want, kiss my ass, I love you)
I got—
You know I've been caught up in my lie
It's never for the worst
I was never fighting for my flight
It was something for the floor
She can't afford to pend my life
So call me to accord
You know I've been caught up in my lie
Heaven was the—
Yeah, no
Couple months, I'll be on my own
I can't see nowhere else as home
But what's it take lettin' all that go?
It's been a while since I tried to start
To show myself how to make a mark
But what are winners if we're all alive?
It ain't in my interest telling you lies
We ain't grew up on the same advice
But ain't shit happened not worth my time
And I ain't givin' up at the 405
If I get lost in foreword, you know this love is fortified
Oh (Ooh), I know this love is fortified
Your tools will teach you things, y'know, they'll teach you things you don't even know you wanna learn
