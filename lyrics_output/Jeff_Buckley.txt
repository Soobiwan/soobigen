When the moon goes down in the dawn
And the sun comes up in the morning
Don't let the sun catch you cryin'
'Cause daddy don't want you, no
Don't let the sun catch you cryin'
Cryin' at my front door
There, you done daddy dirty
He sure don't want you no more
Don't let the sun catch you lyin'
Lyin' at my front door
Your daddy's done turn salty
Baby you've made him so, hmm
You can cry, cry, cry
Yes baby, you can wail
Beat your head on the pavement
'Til the man comes and throws you in jail
But don't let the sun catch you cryin'
Cryin' at my front door
You done daddy dirty
He sure don't want you no more
You can cry, cry, cry, cry
Yes, baby you can wail
Beat your head on the pavement
'Til the man comes and throws you in jail
But don't let the sun catch you cryin'
Cryin' at my front door
You done daddy dirty
He sure don't want you no more
When the moon goes down in the dawnin'
And the sun comes up in the morning
Don't let the sun catch you cryin'
'Cause daddy don't want you no more
I just like that song, um
I don't know who wrote that, but, you know, it's just don't let the sun catch you cryin', everybody sings it
Louis Jordan, Ray Charles, all those people

It looks like rain today
It crackled on the speakers
And trickled down the sleepy subway trains
For heavy eyes could hardly hold us
Aching legs that often told us
It's all worth it
We all fall in love sometimes
The full moon's bright
And starlight filled the evening
We wrote it and I played it
Something happened it's so strange this feeling
Naive notions that were childish
Simple tunes that tried to hide it
But when it comes
We all fall in love sometimes
Did we, didn't we, should we couldn't we
I'm not sure 'cause sometimes we're so blind
Struggling through the day
When even your best friend says
Don't you find
We all fall in love sometimes
And only passing time
Could kill the boredom we acquired
Running with the losers for a while
But our empty sky was filled with laughter
Just before the flood
Painting worried faces with a smile

Eternal life is now on my trail
Got my red glitter coffin, man, just need one last nail
While all these ugly gentlemen play out their foolish games
There's a flaming red horizon that screams our names
And as your fantasies are broken in two
Did you really think this bloody road
Would pave the way for you?
You better turn around
And blow your kiss hello to life eternal, angel
Racist everyman, what have you done?
Man, you've made a killer of your unborn son...
Crown my fear your king at the point of a gun
All I want to do is love everyone...
And as your fantasies are broken in two
Did you really think this bloody road
Would pave the way for you?
You better turn around
And blow your kiss hello to life eternal
There's no time for hatred, only questions
What is love, where is happiness
What is life, where is peace?
When will I find the strength to bring me release?
Tell me where is the love in what your prophet has said?
Man, it sounds to me just like a prison for the walking dead
And I've got a message for you and your twisted hell
You better turn around and blow your kiss goodbye to life eternal angel
Angel

I shiver now, to think of how this answer asked her, no
Long time gone
I run to my hideout
There ain't a star born that brightens
More than you, you always should have known, Joan
I'll illuminate your question
Long time ago I'd died and gone
What has brought the question?
Time has brought the question
Come and call the question, Oh, oh, oh
Here are the stars, same thing again
Over, over, over, over, over, over
Over, over, over, over, over, over

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ah, ah
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm lying in my bed, the blanket is warm
This body will never be safe from harm
Still feel your hair, black ribbons of coal
Touch my skin to keep me whole
Oh, if only you'd come back to me
If you laid at my side
Wouldn't need no Mojo Pin
To keep me satisfied
Don't wanna weep for you, don't wanna know
I'm blind and tortured, the white horses flow
Memories fire, the rhythms fall slow
Black Beauty, I love you so
Oh, precious, precious, silver and gold
And pearls in oyster's flesh
Drop down, we two to serve
And pray to love
Born again from the rhythm
Screaming down from heaven
Ageless, ageless
And I'm there in your arms
Don't wanna weep for you, I don't wanna know
I'm blind and tortured, the white horses flow
The memories fire, the rhythms fall slow
Black beauty, I love you so
So, slow, so, ah
Oh, the welts of your scorn, my love, give me more
Send whips of opinion down my back, give me more
Well, it's you I've waited my life to see
It's you I've searched so hard for
Don't wanna weep for you, don't wanna know
I'm blind and tortured, the white horses flow
The memories fire, the rhythms fall slow
Black beauty, I love you so
So, black, black, black beauty

Circle around the park, joining hands in silence
Watch the evil black the sky
The storm has ripped the shelter of illusion from our brow
This power is no mystery to us now
Leave your spirit genocide, the cancer you won’t remove
We cast our funeral rose inside and bury the need to prove
Our mutilation is to gain from the system
Turn your head away from the screen, oh people
It will tell you nothing more
Don’t suck the milk of flaccid Bill K. Public’s empty promise
To the people that the public can ignore
This way of life is so devised to snuff out the mind that moves
Moving with grace the men despise, and women have learned to lose
Throw off your shame or be a slave to the system
I see you take another drag
One more lost soul to raise your flag
The sky is a landfill
I see you take another drag
Let’s see you take another drag
You like to dance to the rolling head of the adulteress
You sing in praise of suicide
We know you’re useless
Like cops at the scene of a crime
With your steroids and your feedbag and your stable and your trainer
I got a mail bomb for you, Mr. Strong Arm
Throw out the stones from all the cemetery homes
For the violence of a nation gone by
Or the politics of weakness and the garbage dump of souls
That will now black the sky
Their yellow haze and crowds of eyes will plug up the mind that moves
Moving with grace the men despise, and women have learned to lose
We'll share our bodies in disdain for the system
I see you take another drag
One nation bends to kiss the hag
The sky is a landfill
I see you take another drag
I see you take another drag
I have no fear of this machine

If you knew how I miss you
You would not stay away today
Don't you know how I need you
Stay here, my dear, with me
I need you here beside me
Forever and a day, a day
Together, never parting
Just you, just me, my love
I can't go on without you
Your love is all I'm living for
I love all things about you
Your heart, your soul, my love
I can't go on without you
Forever and a day, a day
I need you here beside me
Forever and a day, a day
And no-one else besides me
I love you, I love you
I do

There is a child sleeping near his twin
The pictures go wild in a rush of wind
That dark angel, he is shuffling in
Watching over them with his black feather wings unfurled
The love you lost with her skin so fair
Is free with the wind in her butterscotch hair
Her green eyes blew goodbyes
With her head in her hands
And your kiss on the lips of another
Dream, brother with your tears scattered round the world
Don't be like the one who made me so old
Don't be like the one who left behind his name
'Cause they're waiting for you like I waited for mine
And nobody ever came
Don't be like the one who made me so old
Don't be like the one who left behind his name
'Cause they're waiting for you like I waited for mine
And nobody ever came
Don't be like the one who made me so old
Don't be like the one who left behind his name
'Cause they're waiting for you like I waited for mine
And nobody ever came (Nobody ever came)
I feel afraid and I call your name
I love your voice and your dance insane, I
I hear your words and I know your pain
With your head in your hands and her kiss on the lips of another
Your eyes to the ground and the world spinning round forever
Asleep in the sand with the ocean washing over

He bear her off, he bear her down
He bear her into an orchard ground
Lu-li-lu-lay-lu-li-lu-lay
The falcon hath bourne my mate away
And in that orchard, there was a hold
That was hanged with purple and gold
And in that hold, there was a bed
And it was hanged with gold so red
Lu-li-lu-lay-lu-li-lu-lay
The falcon hath bourne my mate away
And on this bed, there lyeth a knight
His wound is bleeding day and night
By his bedside kneeleth a maid
And she weepeth both night and day
Lu-li-lu-lay-lu-li-lu-lay
The falcon hath bourne my mate away
By his bedside standeth a stone
Corpus christi written thereon

And i fought on foreign sands for you
Once i was a hunter
And i brought home fresh meat for you
Once i was a lover
And i searched behind your eyes for you
And soon there'll be another
To tell you i was just a lie
And sometimes i wonder
Just for a while
Will you remember me
And though you have forgotten
All of our rubbish dreams
I find myself searching
Through the ashes of our ruins
For the days when we smiled
And the hours that ran wild
With the magic of our eyes
And the silence of our words
And sometimes i wonder
Just for a while
Will you remember me

Oh, we're rolling
Goodness
Is there any reverb to roll with?
Yes, he wants- he wants it out here
We're just tuning it up
Lovely thing it is

Have you heard this talk about eye contact
Gonna be the downfall of this town
First the photographs take you to the right hands
Leads you to the authority mold
Paranoia will write the world prayer
Make sure that you fit in and fill the right hole
But when you take his offer, you're done for
Done for, Oh!
Phantoms in pockets, we're in panic
Making order in total disgust
Oh, they read a list of all who cannot stay
Take you down, on the ground
Paranoia will write this world prayer
Make sure that you fit in the right holes
But when you take his offer, you're done for
Done for, Oh!
Make sure you learn to beware your neighbor
Bolt the doors and then hire your guards
Suck your life with their virus called language
Someone told you this all would go down
And the last thing you see is the luster
Hold the razor, goodbye to your friends
Would your underground please call the mayor
Call the neighbor, call your friends
Paranoia will write the world prayer
Make sure that you fit in the right holes
But will you (fold?) his offer
Done for, done for! Ohhh!
Well, when he first saw you, you'd need no protection
Eyes trained on your mouth, you gonna learn to take him
Hmmm. It's a brand new power. Oh!
Ohhhh...
My friend had her questions right
Beware your neighbor
Haven't you heard, haven't you heard
That we're all done for. Ohhh
Learn to beware your neighbor
And the right mode
Haven't you heard?
Haven't you heard
That we're all done, done for? Ohhh
When I count down from ten
You'll feel the lead in your lids
And you have no need to resist
And wake up refreshed
Hah!

Kisses on my mouth with his eyes rolling out of the socket
Memories crumbling under solid still resistance
I was torn out like pages from The Book of Existence
I woke up in a strange place
My mind a blur and some blood on my chin
I made a call for that Black Death cab
My destination is moving on in
And I remember words you told me
Came down so hard, so plain
Fate is gonna find you, Love
In your glass of champagne
Love came calling as a counterfeit mistress
Stealing from the pockets of her sadomasochist
Mouthing falsе praise like a tongue on crystal mеth
Cigarette smelled like the fear inside my chest
Yes and I lied to my host that I knew how far I could go
When I emptied my guts out on his brand new stereo
He paid me to go on upstairs and spend the night with his friend
I never want to see my face in the mirror again
I woke up in a strange place
Music so loud I spit up my beer
I took a ride down in that Black Death cab
My destination is already here
Easy now, car is speeding up
For my last chance crash into freedom
Fate is going to find you, Love
In your glass of champagne
Sweat pours down, I'm in the back seat sleeping
She watches from her empty bed, out the window, weeping
Ghost guns that motor to the land that he promised me
Drawbridge abandoned and the mother needs nowhere
This is a song for you, Dislocated
You're born to love, but it turned to be hated
Because the lies of the spirit possessed you
Because the eyes of your lover resist you
Listen up, boy, I'm shouting from the bottom
Of a barrel, heading down the rapids, yeah
Steady now, keep your aim solid
As your temple turns to kiss the pistol
Fate is going to find you, My Love
In your glass of champagne
Fate is going to find you, Love
In your glass of champagne
Fate is going to find you, Love
In your glass of champagne

I see faces and traces of home
Back in New York City
So you think I'm a tough kid
Is that what you heard?
Well, I like to see some action
And it gets into my blood
Well, they let me out of Pontiac when I was just seventeen
I had to get it out of me if you know what I mean, what I mean
Aaah, they say I must be crazy
'Cause I don't care who I hit, who I hit
'Cause I know it's me that's hitting out
And I'm not full of shit
Down by my bottle, filled up high with gasoline
You can tell by the night fires where Rael has been, has been
As I cuddled the porcupine, he said I had none to blame but me
Held my heart, deep in hell, time to shave, shave it off, it off
No time for romantic escape when your fluffy heart is ready for rape
No! No time for romantic escape when your fluffy heart is ready for rape
Off we go
Off we go
Off we go
You're sitting in your comfort, you don't believe I'm real
Well, you cannot buy protection from the way that I feel
Your progressive hypocrites hand out their trash
It was mine in the first place, so I'll burn it to ash
When I've taken all the strongest meats
And laid them down in coloured sheets
Laid them down in coloured sheets
Who needs illusion of love and affection
When you're out walking in the streets
Your mainline connection
Connection
As I cuddled the porcupine he said I had none to blame but me
Held my heart deep in hell time to shave, shave it off, it off
No time for romantic escape when your fluffy heart is ready for rape
No! No time for romantic escape when your fluffy heart is ready for rape
No! No time for romantic escape when your fluffy heart is ready for rape
No time
Back in New York City

Looking out the door I see the rain
Fall upon the funeral mourners
Parading in a wake of sad relations
As their shoes fill up with water
Maybe I'm too young
To keep good love from going wrong
But tonight you're on my mind
So you never know
Broken down and hungry for your love
With no way to feed it
Where are you tonight, child
You know how much I need it
Too young to hold on
And too old to just break free and run
Sometimes a man gets carried away
When he feels like he should be having his fun
And much too blind to see the damage he's done
Sometimes a man must awake to find that really, he has no-one
So I'll wait for you, and I'll burn
Will I ever see your sweet return
Oh, will I ever learn?
Oh lover, you should've come over
Cause it's not too late
Lonely is the room, the bed is made
The open window lets the rain in
Burning in the corner is the only one
Who dreams he had you with him
My body turns and yearns
For a sleep that won't ever come
It's never over
My kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder
It's never over
All my riches for her smiles when I slept so soft against her
It's never over
All my blood for the sweetness of her laughter
It's never over
She's the tear that hangs inside my soul forever
Well maybe I'm just too young
To keep good love from going wrong
Oh... Ohh... Ohhhhh... Ohhhhhh...
Ohh..... lover, you should've come over
Yes, yes, I feel too young to hold on
And I'm much too old to break free and run
Too deaf, dumb, and blind to see the damage I've done
Sweet lover, you should've come over
Oh, love well I'll wait for you
Lover, lover, lover
Lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover
Lover, lover, lover you should've come over
Cause it's not too late

With my keys in his pocket
Kisses in my mouth with his
Eyes hanging out of his sockets
My memories crumble
Under still resistance
I was torn out like pages
From the book of existence
I woke up in a strange place
My mind a blur and some blood on my chin
I made a call for a blackened cab
Some destination was moving on in
I remember the words that you told me
How they come down so hard, so plain
Fate is going to find your love in a glass of champagne
Love came calling as a counterfeit mistress
Stealing from the pockets of a sadomasochist
Well she's mouthing for his place like a tongue on crystal meth
The cigarette smelling like the feeling inside my chest
I woke up in a strange place
Music so loud that I spit up my beer
I met a ride in that blackened cab
Some destination was moving on in
Easy now, this car is speeding up
For my last chance, crashing to freedom
Fate is going to find your love in a glass of champagne
Sweat pours down
You're in the back seat sleeping
And she waits by the window
From an empty bed, weeping
The ghost guns the motor
To the land that he promised me
I guess this is the time when your
Best intentions become accidents
This is my story for the dislocated
You're born to love but who turn to be hated
Because the lies of the spirit possessed you
Because the eyes of your lover resist you
Listen up, you keep your aim steady
As your temple turns to kiss the pistol
Fate is going to find your love in a glass of champagne

Watching the trains speed along
Weep, oh willow weep
Let me hear your song
So that my soul can be filled with joy
My heart and I
So alone in the fright I bear, so I asked
"How long, how long will it take me to be your man again?"
Tell me Mama
"Oh How long, how long will it take me to be your man again?"
As I try my best not to sigh
I still feel the tears on my face
I'm hated by you, you're loved by me
Though I can't take it, I will try not to break it
My heart and I
So alone in the fright I bear, so I asked
"How long, how long will it take me to be your man again?"
Oh tell me now
"How long, how long will it take me to be your man again?"
As I try my best not to sigh
I still feel the tears on my face
I'm hated by you, you're loved by me
Though I can't take it, I will try not to break it
My heart and I
So alone in the fright I bear, so I asked
"How long, how long will it take me to be your man again?"
Tell me sister
How long will it take me, will it take me
Oh so alone in the fright I bear, so I asked
How long will it take me, will it take me to be your man again?"
Will it take me to be your man again

Secret compartments hide all of the skeletons
Little girl wants to make her home with him
In the middle of the shore, she wonders
"Don't know what you asked for"
"Don't know what you asked for"
All young lovers know why
Nightmares blind their mind's eye
Your rube is young and handsome
So new to your bedroom floor
You know damn well where you'll go
I've loved so many times and I've drowned them all
From their coral graves, they rise up when darkness falls
With their bones they'll scratch the window

Ah.Ah.Ah

This is, uh, based on some music that I heard in a dream
That I saw in a dream
Called, it's going to be called "you and I", ouch
'Cause it's what the people in the dream were saying
You and I, you and I, you and I
All for you
It's like that, I heard the people singing that in a dream
Yeah, and it was a dream where I was in an auditorium at a college
And everybody was congregated and singing the same words
And there was this like, y'know a bunch of
This band on stage and they were like, y'know, sorta spacey Deadhead band
With teen- y'know, like, guys in their twenties, like a bunch of grunge guys but
Kinda playing this, this other thing, not like what I'm playing here on guitar
And the people kept on beating out, uh, rhythms on drumsticks
This really great rhythm, it was in like, 7/4, it was this really cool space jam
And what it was, it was a song
I dreamed that this song was about, uh, about this guy, uh
Or, y'know, the person in the song is singing to his lover
Supposedly
That uh, y'know, that he's completely theirs
The lover has forbidden anybody to have contact with him
The lover has taken away his freedom, taken away his days and nights
Taken away his, y'know, his dreams
Uh, sent away his friends
Forbidden him to, y'know, get close to his parents, all that stuff
And what it was, it was an AIDS rally
And that song was about AIDS
Or about something like that
So every time the refrain came around
The people would say "you and I, you and I, you and I"
And they point to the sign that said, y'know, like, it said AIDS with a circle with a slash through it
And they go "all for you"
They go like, point to the sign, so that was the dream
I woke up with it
'Kay?
Anyway, as long as you got that on tape, I'll remember that

Oooh, oooh
You sound just like a scream
I don’t know what you mean
Your witchcraft’s all around me in your ragged pagan scene
You tell me all the ways around my garden that you like
I float just like a bubble heading for a spike
All is well between the breasts of passenger and slave
We’ll never make it out alive to join the witches’ rave
You’d like to see him suffer for your fantasy and thrill
He fell sick while we made love, he’s out there, somewhere still
Oh, I feel the spell that you have cast
Hot, pink, nasty bubble gum
Coming down just like a big, red coal
I can’t help from looking outside for a guarantee
I can’t help from looking outside for a guarantee
Hey!
I try to keep all hidden when you come around
Oh no, the sight of broomsticks sliding on the ground
You’re levitating something
‘Cause I feel so collectible
We’re all lying natural
He’s watching from a window up above
I see, he loves you
I’ll bring you closer
Something in my fate says it’s not right for me
Tell me, am I cursed or am I blessed?
I can’t tell, oh yes
'Cause all is well between the breasts of passenger and slave
I’ll never make it out alive to join the witches’ rave
Oooh, oooh
I can’t help from looking outside for a guarantee, oh
I can’t help from looking outside for a guarantee, ooh
I can’t help from looking outside for a guarantee, ooh
I can’t help from looking outside for a guarantee, ooh
I can’t help from looking outside for a guarantee, ooh
I can’t help from looking outside for a guarantee, ooh
I can’t help from looking outside for a guarantee, ooh
For a guarantee

Underneath the skull of a moon
Fire burned his eyes out
Cause his chains are too long for you
Someone has to pay for the damage done. no-one's gonna love you now
Your whole family's splintered, you're a slave to it all now
Ooooo ahhhhh
Oh, you're a slave to it all now
You're a slave
Welcome down to paradise rock. there is no single entrance
With the stars to revolve around
There is no real underground
No stars to revolved around
Here, they're fashioning the noose
Sickened by the knell of the graveyard bell
You know it's not long for you
Sick of all the vomit childhood
Not a trampoline of the freaks
Not even a slave to your father
Oh, you're a slave to it all, now
Oh, you're a slave to it all, now
Welcome down to paradise rock
There is no single entrance
With the stars to revolve around
There is no real underground
There is not a single entrance
There's no stars to revolve around
There is no real underground
You're a slave to it all, now
Happy, happy, happy
Happy, happy, happy, happy

There is a child sleeping near his twin
The pictures go wild in a rush of wind
That dark angel he is shuffling in
Watching over them with his black feather wings unfurled
The love you lost with her skin so fair
Is free with the wind in her butterscotch hair
Her green eyes blew goodbyes
With her head in her hands
And your kiss on the lips of another
Dream, brother with your tears scattered round the world
Don't be like the one who made me so old
Don't be like the one who left behind his name
Cause they're waiting for you like I waited for mine
And nobody ever came
Don't be like the one who made me so old
Don't be like the one who left behind his name
Cause they're waiting for you like I waited for mine
And nobody ever came
Don't be like the one who made me so old
Don't be like the one who left behind his name
Cause they're waiting for you like I waited for mine
And nobody ever came
Nobody ever came
I feel afraid and I call your name
I love your voice and your dance insane
I hear your words and I know your pain
With your head in your hands and her kiss on the lips of another
Your eyes to the ground and the world spinning round forever
Asleep in the sand with the ocean washing over

The world is diagnosed with terminal cancer
Flesh is not union this culture is not freedom
And the world has terminal cancer
I want to live with you
Let's bomb the moonlight and dance
This far awake is a joke our love is real
And the world is diagnosed with terminal cancer
I love your lips before the apocalypse
Armageddon's just another job, it's all on the inside
Don't let them tell you love is a lie
Love is so real
The best bet's to stay alive
Let's go bomb the moonlight
Let's take it back
What was ours by right
Frame of a picture, the subject's not right
Oh people of the world
You have a new boy in town
To share the light with a guillotine
That's realer than all of you
That's love human
We'll bomb the moonlight and dance
Dance
Sweet black mother of death
Why did you have to take her away from me?
It's stupid all the words fit together
Where now is nothing
Why did you have to bring us together
Under such dirty circumstance?
I have a molotov
Let's bomb the moonlight and dance
Dance dance dance dance dance dance dance dance dance

I'd fly up the river to the one I love
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well
I've got a man, he's long and tall
Moves his body like a cannon ball
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well
One of these days and it won't be long
Call my name and I'll be gone
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well
I remember one night, a drizzling rain
Round my heart I felt an achin' pain
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well
When I wore my apron low
Couldn't keep you from my do
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well
Now I wear my apron high
Scarcely ever see you passing by
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well
Now my apron's up to my chin
You pass my door and you won't come in
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well
If I had listened to what my mama said
I'd be at home in my mama's bed
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well

While this town is busy sleeping
All the noise has died away
I walk the streets to stop my weeping
'Cause she'll never change her ways
But don't fool yourself
She was heartache from the moment that you met her
Ah, my heart feels so still as I try to find the will
To forget her somehow
Oh, I think I've forgotten her now
Her love is a rose, pale and dying
Dropping her petals in land unknown
All full of wine, the world before her
Was sober with no place to go
Mmm
Don't fool yourself
She was heartache from the moment that you met her
My heart is frozen still as I try to find the will
To forget her somehow
She's somewhere out there now
Well, my tears falling down as I try to forget
Her love was a joke from the day that we met
All of the words, all of her men
All of my pain when I think back to when
Remember her hair as it shone in the sun
The smell of the bed when I knew what she'd done
Tell yourself over and over you won't ever need her again
But don't fool yourself
She was heartache from the moment that you met her
Oh, my heart is frozen still as I try to find the will
To forget her somehow
She's out there somewhere now
Oh, she was heartache from the day that I first met her
My heart is frozen still as I try to find the will
To forget you somehow
'Cause I know you're somewhere out there right now
I don't wanna ban her
Oh, oh, oh, oh

(This is called "Poor Boy")
Me and poor boy was travelling
Travelling a long way from home
Me and poor boy got pulled off
Got pulled off and prison bound
My dear mother, she got worried
When we was down all in the farm
Mama, she called that farmer on up
And they told her that her sons' prison bound
My dear mother got on the farm
She called down a little farm
My mother talked to the sergeant
He wanted not to have mercy out on bail
Well this sergeant told dear mother
He would take 200 dollar bill
We didn't have no one
To come and get us out on bail
Poor boy, he got all worried
Come walking to us breaking down
I said "Poor boy, don't worry
Our mother get us out of prison bound"
Well this sergeant told dear mother
He would take two hundred dollar bill
We didn't have no one
To come and get us out of bail
Oh, my mother she got worried
She couldn't get them two hundred dollar bill
So one Sunday morning
My mother, she drove to the farm
Well, the sergeant met my mother
Drove on up to her at the gate
My mother, she told the sergeant
She never had no two hundred dollar bill!
Well, my mother she kneeled down
My mother kneeled down on her knee
Oh, my mother pleas the Sergeant
"Will you please sir have some mercy on me?"
My dear mother, she really cryin'
Told the sergeant, then she broke down
He said "These boys promised
They will not hobo on my train!"
I said "Listen, brother poor boy
Don't be worried cryin'
Somebody, somebody, somewhere
Is gonna get us off prison bound"

Yet every distance is not near
So I remember every face
Of every man who put me here
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released
They say every man needs protection
They say every man must fall
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Some place so high above this wall
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released
Standing next to me in this lonely crowd
Is a man who swears he's not to blame
All day long I hear him shout so loud
Crying out that he was framed
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

I know you're a woman by the way you burn below
I'll tell you secrets so good, you'll never tell a soul
Come closer, my bonfire, holds his life like stones
My years, my life unknown
Diamonds from the pavement where the broken glass had been
Just like these troubles that I'm leaving to the wind
Like sapphires in boxcars speeding towards the end
Like thieves, my bad luck grows
Jewel box of sadness, ring to catch your tear
Crystallize illusions shine forgotten here
Jewel box of sadness, ring to catch your tear
Oh, you left some stars in my belly
Star-crossed child's love on the band of wedding gold
Silver studs of promise hide in the red crushed velvet folds
Inaction, intention, like emeralds I stole
My speech of costume gold
I think I ought to know
Jewel box of sadness, ring to catch your tear
Crystallize illusions shine forgotten here
Jewel box of sadness, ring to catch your tear
Oh, you left some stars in my belly
You left some stars in my belly
You left some stars in my belly

If the sea should suddenly run dry
If you love me, really love me
Let it happen darling, I don't care
Shall I catch a shooting star
Shall I bring it where you are
If you want me to, I will
You can set me any task
I'll do anything you ask
If you'll only love me still
When at last, our life on earth is through
I will spend eternity with you
If you love me, really love me
Let it happen darling, I won't care

I used to know a little square
So long ago, when I was small
All summer long it had a fair
Wonderful fair with swings and all
I used to love my little square
And at the close of every day
I could be found, dancing around
A merry-go-round that used to play...
Oh, mon amour
A toi toujours
Dans tes grands yeux
Rien que nous deux
All summer long my little fair
Made everyday like a holiday
Night after night it used to play
And people came there from so far away
And everyone sang that little tune
All around town you heard it played
Even Pepi from Napoli
He sang to marie
This serenade...
Oh, mon amour
A toi toujours
Dans tes grands yeux
Rien que nous deux
All summer long my little fair
Made everyday like a holiday
Night after night it used to play
And people came there from so far away
And everyone sang that little tune
All around town you heard it played
Even Pepi from Napoli
He sang to marie
This serenade...
Oh, mon amour
A toi toujours
Dans tes grands yeux
Rien que nous deux
I can't forget my little square
Even though i'm so far away
I can't forget my little fair
Maybe it's still there, still there today
I sometimes hear that little tune
Playing in a dream of long ago
And in my brain runs the refrain
That old french refrain i used to know...
Oh, mon amour
A toi toujours
Dans tes grands yeux
Rien que nous deux

It's an angry song
Life's too short
And too complicated for people behind desks and people behind masks to be ruining other people's lives
Initiating force against other people's lives
On the basis of their income, their color, their class, their religious beliefs, their whatever

Nooooo, no, no, noooo
Nobody feels any pain
Tonight as I stand inside the rain
Everybody knows
That baby's got new clothes
But lately I've seen her ribbons and her bows
Have fallen from her curls
As she takes just like a woman, yeah
And she makes love just like a woman, oh
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl
Queen Mary, she's my friend
Yes I believe I'll go see her again
Nobody has to guess
Baby can't be blessed
Till she finally sees that
She's like all the rest
With her fog, her amphetamines and her pearls
As she takes just like a woman
Yeah she does
And she makes love just like a woman
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl
Well it was raining from the first
And I was dying there of thirst
So I came in here
And your long-time curse hurts
But what's worse
Is are this pain here
I can't stay here
Baby
Ain't it clear that
I just can't fit
I believe it's time for us to quit
When we meet again
Introduced as friends
Please don't you let on
That you knew me when
I was hungry and
It was your world
Oh, you fake just like a woman
Yes you do
And you make love just like a woman
And then you ache just like a woman
But you break just like a little girl
But you break just like a little girl

I see the rain fall upon the funeral mourners
Parading in a wake of sad relations
As their shoes fill up with waterAnd maybe I'm too young
To keep good love from going wrong
But tonight, you're on my mind so
You never knowBroken down and hungry for your love
With no way to feed it
Where are you tonight?
Child, you know how much I need it
Too young to hold on
And too old to just break free and runSometimes a man gets carried away
When he feels like he should be having his fun
Much too blind to see the damage he's done
Sometimes a man must awake to find that, really
He has no oneSo I'll wait for you and I'll burn
Will I ever see your sweet return
Oh, will I ever learn?
Oh, lover, you should have come over
'Cause it's not too lateLonely is the room the bed is made
The open window lets the rain in
Burning in the corner is the only one
Who dreams he had you with himMy body turns and yearns for a sleep
That won't ever come it's never over
My kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder
It's never over, all my riches for her smiles
When I slept so soft against her
It's never overAll my blood for the sweetness of her laughter
It's never over, she's the tear
That hangs inside my soul forever
Oh, but maybe I'm just too young
To keep good love from going wrongOh, lover you should have come over
Yeah, I feel too young to hold on
I'm much too old to break free and run
Too deaf, dumb, and blind
To see the damage I've doneSweet lover, you should have come over
Oh, love I'm waiting for you
Lover, lover, lover, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love
Lover, you should have come over
'Cause it's not too late

Through the river and the sea
Gold sharks glittering
A tree of white breaks the earth
The streets where Lola played
Very sexy, very sexy
Okay, okay
Fear, we may come. (X 4)
So run, run, run, run, run, run, run
It's in your heart, it's in your art, your beauty
Even in this world of lies, there's purity
You've got innocence in your eyes
Even in this world of lies, you're still hopeful
Very sexy, very sexy
Okay, okay
Fear, we may come. (X 4)
So run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Through the yard, through the yard of blonde girls
Through the river and the sea
Gold sharks glittering
A tree of white breaks the earth
The streets where Lola played
Very sexy, very sexy
Okay, okay
Fear, we may come. (X 4)
So run, run, run, run, run, run, run

When I first saw you
You had on blue jeans
Your eyes couldn't hide anything
I saw you breathing, oh
Saw you staring out in space
When I next saw you
You were at the party
Thought you was a queen, oh, so flirty
I came against them
Didn't say excuse
Knew what I was doing
We looked very fine
As we were leaving
As we were making
What we were making
Saint John
You were a cool jerk
Oh, I want you
Like a kangaroo

With my keys in his pocket
Kisses on my mouth with his
Eyes hanging out of his sockets
My memories crumble
Under still resistance
I was torn out like pages
From the book of existence
I woke up in a strange place
My mind a blur and some blood on my chin
I made a call for a blackened cab
Some destination was moving on in
I remember the words that you told me
How they come down so hard, so plain
Fate is going to find your love in a glass of champagne
I lied to my host I told him
I knew how far I could go
Then I emptied my guts out
On his brand new stereo
Well he paid me to go upstairs
And spend a night with his friend
I never want to see my face in the mirror again
I woke up in a strange place
Music so loud that I spit up my beer
I met a ride in that blackened cab
Some destination was all that he had
Easy now, this car is speeding up
For my last chance, crashing to freedom
Fate is going to find your love in a glass of champagne
Sweat pours down
You're in the back seat sleeping
And she waits by the window
On an empty bed, weeping
The ghost guns the motor
To the land that he promised me
I guess this is the time when your
Best intentions become accidents
This is my story for the dislocated
Who want to love but who turn to be hated
Because the lies of the spirit possessed you
Because the eyes of your lover resist you
Listen now, you keep your aim steady
As your temple turns to kiss the pistol
Fate is going to find your love in a glass of champagne
Fate is going to find your love
In a glass of champagne

This would be much better if we weren't recording
Since I'm in this tuning I'll just go right now
Is everybody alright?
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier
She left here last early spring, is livin' there, I hear
Say for me that I'm all right, though new things come and go
She might think that I've forgotten her, but don't tell her it isn't so
We had a falling out, like lovers often will
But to think of how she left that night, still gives me a chill
And though our separation, well, it chilled me to the heart
She still lives on inside of me, we've never been apart
If you're making love to her, kiss her for the kid
Who always has respected her for doing what she did
For I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards
But the bitter taste still lingers on, it all came down so hard
Well, I meet a lot of people as I make the rounds
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off
Well, either I'm too sensitive, or else I'm just getting soft
If you see her...
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past
I know every scene by heart, because they all went by so fast
If she's passin' back this way, I'm not that hard to find
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time

Feel the power you cut the truth into you
Why do you think I did not on this rely?
I could kiss you with lines of escape in my mouth
Please let me bring back these gifts of mine to the woman
Stars shined on my back as I slept and knew you
You didn't leave it all
You made an even call
My belly released the stars and tears between the scars
Ooh
Below this we'll end here until the end of time
Beyond the moment that ends our bondage
I am your failed husband contender
I'm your loan shark of bliss
This dream you've ridden on turns your world to explosions
I need to be alone to heal this bleeding stone
Now, smell the rain of London, it still insists
That we beg for our purity
As if we are pure in the reign of our contentment
As if I can think of this no more

I'm gonna kick 'em out
Well, I feel pretty good
And I guess that I could get crazy, now baby
'Cause we all got in tune
And when the dressing room got hazy, now baby
I know how you want it, child
Hot, sweet and tight
When girls can't stand it
When you're doing it right
Let me up on the stand
And let me kick out the jam
Yes, kick out the jams
I like to kick'em out
Yes, I'm starting to sweat
You know my shirt's all wet, what a feeling
In the sound that abounds
And resounds and rebounds off the ceiling
You gotta have it, baby
You can't do without
When you get that feeling
You gotta sock 'em out
Put that mic in my hand
And let me kick out the jam
Yes, kick out the jams
Got to kick'em out
So you got to get it up
And then can't get enough, that's what
'Cause it gets in your brain
It drives you insane, makes you crazy
The wigglin' guitars the faster you funk
If you wanna feed my rocket
Till the morning comes
Let me be who I am
And let me kick out the jams
Yes kick out the jams
I done kick 'em out

We learn to loathe the truth as it shines
I already see the ghosts on the sidewalk
Kissing in the hereafter
And your hands are in your pockets as you face her
And your bodies both frozen by the dawn
Only one knows they're watching it die
The other from hereafter
Young life crosses young love
You've learned to think life is for somebody else
You make it hard to live it for yourself
And the man you love just doesn't know just what he's after
Chances are you wouldn't even recognize the man I am now
Chances are you wouldn't even recognize the man I am now
Chances are you wouldn't even recognize the man I am now
Yeah, make up any excuse
To wear the reins you can't control
The knife wanders through me so slow
It cuts between us as we grow
Ooooh
Mmm
(That's all, that's all it is)

Okay, here we go
Sometimes I'm right, others I'm wrong
My own beliefs are in my song
The butcher, the baker, the drummer and then
Makes no difference 'bout the group I'm in
But
I am everyday people, yeah yeah
There is a blue one, who won't-
What is it?
There is a..
There is a thin one
I don't know it
I don't fuckin' know it
It's over here, here we go
Take it all back
Sometimes I'm right, others I'm wrong
My own beliefs are in my song
The butcher, the baker, the drummer and then
Makes no difference 'bout the group I'm in
But
I am everyday people, yeah yeah
There is a blue one, that won't accept the green one
For living with a fat one , trying to be a skinny one
Different strokes
For different folks
And so on and so on and scooby doo bee doo bee
Ooh sha sha, we got to live together
I am no better, and neither are you
We are the same whatever we do
You love me, you hate me you know me and then
You can't figure out the bag I'm in
I am everyday people, yeah yeah
There is a long hair, that doesn't like the short hair
For being such a rich one, that will not help the poor one
Different strokes
For different folks
And so on and so on and scooby doo bee doo bee
Ooh sha sha, we got to live together
There is a yellow one, that won't accept the black one
That won't accept the red one, that won't accept the white one
Different strokes
For different folks
And so on and so on and scooby doo bee doo bee
Ooh sha sha, we got to live together
I am everyday people, yeah yeah
We all got to live together
I, I, yeah yeah

You could have been New Orleans
You could have been New Orleans
But you’ll just be Hollywood for the rest of your life
You could have been New Orleans
But you’ll just be Hollywood for the rest of your life
I saw her stranded with her neck in a rope
She was caught red-handed by the river of dope
I guess it caught her fancy just to be by his side
She had no answer when she tried to get high
When you turn to a prison of the camera’s strobe
Famе is religion by the river of dopе
My brain is tired and my woman can cope
It just don’t matter to the river of dope
The door’s no longer open, for my name on their breath
So long I’ve waited, for the coming of death
Will I be united with my innocence gone
Or will I burn to cinders as the river rolls on
Hmmm…river, we sleep in your mud
You give us poison, when we drink your blood
I saw your woman with a seven-foot rope
Hang your dirty laundry by the river of dope
I watched your mother abandon her hope
And she watched you drowning by the river of dope
It felt so damn special to be damaged and free
To have her hairs not feel you, look in my eyes and you’ll see
That I flow with the river, and I’m a slave to his song
And I will drown forever where so many have gone
Goodbye you people who have abandoned your hope
Parade in early morning to the river of dope
Hmm, yeah the river of dope

I loved this sweet guide
Just like affection rushing in your riverbed
Arise like applause in my head
And in the half-light where we both stand
This is the half-light, you see me as I am
Just like the ocean, always in love with the moon
It's overflowing now, inside you
We fly right over the minds of so many in pain
We are the smile of light that brings the rain
In the half light where we both stand
In the half light you saw me as I am
I am a rail road track abandoned
With the sunset forgetting I ever happened
That I ever happened

Love, let me sleep tonight on your couch
And remember the smell of the fabric of your simple city dress
Oh, that was so real
Oh, that was so real
Oh, that was so real
We walked around 'til the moon got full like a plate
And the wind blew an invocation and I fell asleep at the gate
And I never stepped on the cracks 'cause I thought I'd hurt my mother
And I couldn't awake from the nightmare that sucked me in and pulled me under
Pulled me under, oh
Oh, that was so real
Oh, that was so real
Oh, that was so real
I love you
But I'm afraid to love you
I love you
But I'm afraid to love you
I'm afraid
Oh, that was so real
Oh, that was so real
Oh, that was so real
Oh, that was so real
Oh, that was so real (Oh)
Oh, that was so real (Real, real, real)
Oh, that was so real
Oh, that was so real (Oh, yeah)
Oh, that was so real

On thy bosom let me rest
More I would, but death invades me
Death is now a welcome guest
When I am laid in earth, may my wrongs create
No trouble in thy breast
Remember me, but ah! forget my fate

The boy with the thorn in his side
Behind the hatred there lies
A murderous desire
For love, love
How can they look into my eyes
And still they don't believe me?
How can they hear me say those words
Still they don't believe me?
And if they don't believe me now
Will they ever believe me?
And if they don't believe me now
Will they ever believe me?
Oh-ohh
Ohh-oh, ohh-oh, ohh-ohh
The boy with the thorn in his side
Behind the hatred there lies
A plundering desire
For love, love, love
How can they look into our eyes
And still they don't believe us?
And after all this time
They don't want to believe us
And if they don't believe us now
Will they ever believe us?
And when you want to live, how do you start?
Where do you go? Who do you need to know?
Oh, ohh
Oh, ohh, oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, woah-woah
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh
The boy, the boy
Murderous desire for love, love, love
Oh yeah
Alright, the boy-boy-boy-boy
Boy with the thorn in his side
Alright
Boy boy boy
With the thorn in his side
The hatred there lies
A murderous murder, murder, murder
Murderous desire for love, love, love
Hell no
No, I got criticized-
I got like got majorly, majorly faced
From fuckin' Peter Watrous' review that Gods and Monsters show
And he said, "He embarrassed himself with- by doing a Jamaican patois; it was embarrassing at best."
So let's stop that shit
And all the  in my neighborhood think it's like racist and I just, I never hear the end of it
No, I can't
But I- so I do it in private
When I die you'll find all these fuckin' basement tapes of me just doing fuckin' reggae for days
And then those same people pick up their goddamn folky guitars and go y'know "I went down to the porch last night, with my dead dog Rufus yeah-hea"
Oh, that ain't gonna be no f-
They'll be offering you big fuckin' piles of coke to get those second takes
Okay

It brings a tear
Into my eyes
When I begin
To realize
I've cried so much
Since you've been gone
I guess I'm drowning in my own tears
I sit and cry
Just like a child
My pouring tears
Are runnin' wild
If you don't think
You'll be home soon
I guess I'll drown oh yes...in my own tears
I know it's true
Into each life
Ooohh little rain, rain must pour
I'm so blue
Here without you
It keeps raining
More and more
Ooohh and can't you
Please come home
So I won't
Be all alone
If you don't think
You'll be home soon
I guess I'll drown in my own tears
Drown in my own tears
Drown in my own tears
Come on people
Drown in my own tears
Ooh, don't let me
Drown in my own tears
When I'm in trouble, baby drown in my own tears
I guess I'll drown yes, in my own tears
Oooooh uuuuhhhh

Eternal life is now on my trail
Got my red glitter coffin, man, just need one last nail
While all these ugly gentlemen play out their foolish games
There's a flaming red horizon that screams our names
And as your fantasies are broken in two
Did you really think this bloody road
Would pave the way for you?
You better turn around
And blow your kiss hello to life eternal, angel
Racist angry man, what have you done?
Man, you've made a killer of your unborn son
Oh, crown my fear your king at the point of a gun
All I want to do is love everyone
And as your fantasies are broken in two
Did you really think this bloody road
Would pave the way for you?
You better turn around
And blow your kiss hello to life eternal
Oh, oh-oh
Yeah
Oh-ah
Yeah
There's no time for hatred, only questions
What is love? Where is happiness?
What is life? Where is peace?
When will I find the strength that'd bring me release?
Tell me where is the love in what your prophet has said?
Man, it sounds to me just like a prison for the walking dead
And I've got a message for you and your twisted hell
You better turn around and blow your kiss goodbye to life eternal, angel, yeah
Angel
Yeah, angel
Ooh, God, yeah
Ooh

I lost myself on a cool, damp night
I gave myself in that misty light
Was hypnotized by a strange delight
Under a lilac tree
I made wine from the lilac tree
Put my heart in its recipe
It makes me see what I want to see
And be what I want to be
When I think more than I want to think
I do things I never should do
I drink much more than I ought to drink
Because it brings me back you
Lilac wine is sweet and heady
Like my love
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady
Like my love
Listen to me, I cannot see clearly
Isn't that she coming to me?
Nearly here
Lilac wine is sweet and heady
Where's my love?
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady
Where's my love?
Listen to me, why is everything so hazy?
Isn't that she, or am I just going
Crazy, dear?
Lilac wine, I feel unready
For my love
Feel unready
For my love

I'm not hopin' for what I know can't be
All that all I ask is for a kiss each day
I'll give you love that can never blow away
Yes I will
Cause girl I wouldn't ask you to lift up this great big world....yeah baby
I know that you're not that kind of a girl
All that I ask is for a kiss or two
But nothing in this world would be too good for you
Nobody nobody nobody nobody knows
How deep my love for you really goes
Nevermind now, with your heart, how much he's all
Cause girl...I want you to know
I wouldn't ask you to hold back the light of dawn
That's just a little too much to ask of anyone
All that I ask is for your loving words
And I'll keep you happy for the rest of our natural-born days
Nevermind now, with your heart, how much he's all

Judge give me life this mornin'
Down on Parchman farm
Judge give me life this mornin'
Down on Parchman farm
I wouldn't hate it so bad
But I left my wife in mourn
Oh, goodbye wife
All you have done gone
Oh, goodbye wife
All you have done gone
But I hope some day
You will hear my lonesome song
Oh, listen you men
I don't mean no harm
Oh, listen you men
I don't mean no harm
If you wanna do good
You better stay off old Parchman farm
We got to work in the mornin'
Just at dawn of day
We got to work in the mornin'
Just at dawn of day
Just at the settin' of the sun
That's when the work is done
I'll redeem with my home
But the men don't want me around
I'll redeem with my home
But the men don't want me around
They say I'll take their women
Take them out of town
I'm down on Parchman farm
I sho' wanna go back home
I'm down on Parchman farm
But I sho' wanna go back home
But I hope some day
I will overcome
I was up this mornin'
Ah, blues walkin' like a man
I was up this mornin'
Yeah, blues walkin' like a man
Worried blues, give me your right hand
And the blues fell mama's child
Tore me all upside down
Yes
You gonna do it?
Do it now
And the blues fell mama's child
Tore me all upside down
Carry on, poor Bob
Just can't seem to turn you 'round
And the blues, is a achin' old heart disease
And the blues, is a old achin' old heart disease
Killing me like consumption
Killing me like by degrees
I been studyin' the rain
Oh, oh, drive
Oh, oh, drive my blues away
I been studyin' the rain
Oh, oh, drive
Oh, drive my blues away
Goin' out to the 'stil'ry
Stay out there all day

She said she's never coming home
His things were lying on her doorstep
And his tears, they fell like rain
And in his mind, he knew
He'd love her always
Despite the tears
And in this town where few knew love
He'd spend his nights all alone, crying
And all the love he'd once shared with her
Was gone, long, long, long gone
And he knew a part of him was dying
And in his mind
He knew he'd love her always
Despite the tears
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry
Lover we tried, we tried, we tried
And in his mind he knew he'd love her always
Despite the tears

You ask how long I'll love you; I'll tell you true:
Until the twelfth of never, I'll still be loving you
Hold me close, never let me go
Hold, oh hold me close, melt my heart like April snow
I'll love you till the bluebells forget to bloom;
I'm gonna love you till the roses has lost its perfume
Baby I'm gonna love you till the poets run out this rhyme oh yeah
Until the twelfth of never and that's a long, long time

you my love are allowed to shed the weight of all the years before like bad disco clothes, save them for a night of dancing, stoned with you lover
you my love are allowed to let yourself drown every night in bottomless wild and naked symbolic dreams
you my love in sleep can unlock your youth and your most terrifying magic and dreaming is for the courageous
you my love are allowed to grab my guitar and sing me idiot love songs if
you lost your ability to speak, keep it down to two minutes
you my love are allowed to rot and to die and to live again more alive and incandescent than before
you my love are allowed to beat the shit out of your television, choke it's thoughts and corrupt its mind kill kill kill kill the motherf**ker before the song of zombiefied pain and panic and malaise and its narrow right winged vision and its cheap commercial gang rate becomes the white noise of the world (turn about is fair play)
you my love are allowed to forgive and love your television
you my love are allowed to speak in kisses to those around you and those up in heaven
you my love are allowed to show your babies how to dance full bodied, starry eyed, audacious, supernatural and glorified
you my love are allowed to suck in every single endeavor
you my love are allowed to be soaked like a lovers blanket in the New York summertime with the wonder of your own special gift
you my love are allowed to receive praise
you my love are allowed to have time
you my love are allowed to understand
you my love are allowed to love
woman disobey
little man believe
you my love are a rebellion

Fall in light, fall in light
Fall in light, fall in light
Feel no shame for what you are (X 5)
As you now are in your heart
Fall in light
Feel no shame for what you are
Feel no shame for what you are
Feel it as a waterfall
Fall in light, ooh
Fall in light, fall in light
Fall in light, ooh
Fall in light, fall in light fall in light
Grow in light
Stand absolved behind your electric chair, dancing
Stand absolved behind your electric chair, dancing
Past the sound within the sound
Past the voice within the voice
Ah. ah. ah
Leave your office, run past your funeral
Leave your home, car , leave your pulpit
Join us in the streets where we
Join us in the streets where we don't belong..
Don't belong
You and the stars throwing light
Oooooo (repeat) fall, fall
Oooooo fall in, fall in light
Fall in light, ooo
Fall in light, fall in light
Fall in light. grow in light

I received a message from my brother across the water
He sat laughing as he wrote the end's in sight
So I said goodbye to all my friends
And packed my hopes inside a matchbox
Because I know it's time to fly
Oh, yeah come on, meet me in the morning
Meet me in the middle of the night
Ah, yeah, the morning light is coming
Don't it make you wanna go and feel alright?
I just jumped a train that never stops
So now somehow I know I'll never finish paying for my ride
Someone pushed a gun into my hand
Tell me I'm the type of man
To fight the fight without inquiring
Oh, yeah come on, meet me in the morning
Won't you meet me in the middle of the night
Oh, well the morning light is coming
Don't it make you wanna go and feel alright?
Oh, mama, well I think it's time I'm leaving
Nothing here to make me stay
Whoa, mama, well it must be time I'm going
They're knocking down them doors
They're trying to take me away
Please Mr. Brakeman, won't you ring your bell
And ring it loud and clear
Please Mr. Fireman, won't you ring your bell
Tell the people they got to fly away from here
I once saw a picture of a lady with a baby
Southern lady, had a very, very special smile
We are in the middle of a change in destination
When the train stops, all together we will smile
Oh, come on, meet me in the morning
Won't you meet me in the middle of the night, night, night
Everybody know the morning time is coming
Don't it make you wanna feel alright? Ah, ah, yeah
Make me feel alright
Fly now, baby
Get to fly, yeah
Fly now, baby

In your defenseless, winning smile
What do you hope to win?
And bliss face down, defended
Well, now stoned Demon John
There's no town the boy cannot belong
Why did you come here?
Is it to excavate all your sins? Boil within?
Slaughter like the daughter of the devil you send me
I have to deal, you called me here
You couldn't say that you were juiced
The night that you were introduced
To Demon John
Gonna take him with you when you go?
Dance down slow. Oh, way down
You cannot escape the bar-side angel dissector
You undo you life with too much cocoon
Who's your protector?
Dark is the city where the white girls walk by
Down below your eyes, just like fireflies
You call me here, come on here, follow me dear
Past cascades of rage and fear
You called me here
You couldn't say that you had been juiced
The time that you were introduced to Demon John
Well, you knew you had to want to go , dance down slow
By the light of the sun, murder comes
Today or tonight
Better get yourself and transcend it
Or burst of light
Blaze stars into me
While the love breaks through here and now
So, murder by the light of the sun
Please don't get too close to me
You said you are for real, it's not pretend
All memories stolen, know this for yourself
How would you like to be the happiest man in the world?
Behind the weathered field hands, whose blistered
Paws
Harvest cut, for wedding clothes they'll never wear
Marching down a road that was never there
It takes place on a sunlit face and the backbone broken
Please bring us light, Demon John, You Demon John
Take him with you when you go

Parading in a wake of sad relations as their shoes fill up with water
And maybe I'm too young to keep good love from going wrong
But tonight you're on my mind so you never know
When I'm broken down and hungry for your love with no way to feed it
Where are you tonight, child you know how much I need it
Too young to hold on and too old to just break free and run
Sometimes a man gets carried away, when he feels like he should be having his fun
And much too blind to see the damage he's done
Sometimes a man must awake to find that really, he has no-one
So I'll wait for you... and I'll burn
Will I ever see your sweet return
Oh will I ever learn
Oh lover, you should've come over
Cause it's not too late
Lonely is the room, the bed is made, the open window lets the rain in
Burning in the corner is the only one who dreams he had you with him
My body turns and yearns for a sleep that will never come
It's never over, my kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder
It's never over, all my riches for her smiles when I slept so soft against her
It's never over, all my blood for the sweetness of her laughter
It's never over, she's the tear that hangs inside my soul forever
Well maybe I'm just too young
To keep good love from going wrong
Oh...lover, you should've come over
Cause it's not too late
Well I feel too young to hold on
And I'm much too old to break free and run
Too deaf, dumb, and blind to see the damage I've done
Sweet lover, you should've come over
Oh, love well I'm waiting for you
Lover, you should've come over
Cause it's not too late

Take the blood out of an alligator
Take the left eye out of a fish
Take the skin off of a frog
And put 'em all in a dish, huha
Throw some salt over your shoulder
And count from one to nine
Like a scary can freezer
And you got alligator wine
Alligator wine
Your porcupine
It's gonna make you mine, huha
It'll make your baby bald
It make your toes freeze
It'll make you stare out your eye balls
It'll make you cough and sneeze, haa choo
You'd be wanting for air
But I give you my portion 9
When you drink it, alligator wine, huh
Alligator wine
Your porcupine
Gonna make you mine, huh
Alligator wine, your porcupine
It's gonna make you mine
It's gonna make you mine
Huh, look out, who's that? Huh

If I had money, I would do things my way
But little they know that it's so hard to find
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind
Money can't buy back all your youth when you're old
A friend, when you're lonely, or peace to your soul
The wealthiest person is a pauper at times
Compared to the man with a satisfied mind
Oh, oh, yeah, oh yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, mmm
When my life is over and my time has run out
My friends and my loved ones, I will leave, there's no doubt
But, one thing's for certain, when it comes my time
I'll leave this old world, oh yeah, oh yeah, with a satisfied mind
One thing's for certain, when it comes my time, oh yeah
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind, mind, mind, mind, mind
Satisfied mind

Perhaps it is the color of the sun cut flat
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that
But mama, you've been on my mind
I mean no trouble, please don't put me down, don't get upset
I am not pleading, or saying I can't forget you
I do not pace the floor, bowed down and bent, but yet
Well, mama you've been on my mind
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts they might be narrow
Where you've been don't bother me, or bring me down in sorrow
I don't even mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow
But mama, you're just on my mind
I am not askin' you to say words like yes or no
Please understand me, I have no place, I'm calling you to go
I'm just whispering to myself so I can pretend that I don't know
Mama, you're just on my mind
Well, mama you're just on my mind
When you wake up in the morning, baby look inside your mirror
You know I won't be next to, you know I won't be near
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
As someone who has had you on his mind

The other woman finds time to manicure her nails
The other woman is perfect where her rival fails
And she's never seen with pin curls in her hair anywhere
The other woman enchants her clothes with french perfume
The other woman keeps fresh cut flowers in each room
And there are never toys that's scattered everywhere
And when her baby comes to call
He'll find her waiting like a lonesome queen
'Cause when he's by her side
It's such a change from old routine
But the other woman will always cry herself to sleep
The other woman will never have his love to keep
And as the years go by, the other woman will spend her life alone
Let's call it a night

This body will never be, safe from harm
Still feel your hair, black ribbons of coal
Touch my skin, keep me whole
Well, if only you'd come back to me
If you laid at my side
Wouldn't need no Mojo Pin
To keep me satisfied
Don't wanna weep for you, don't wanna know
I'm blind and tortured, the white horses flow
The memories fire, the rhythms fall slow
Black Beauty, I love you so
Uh, precious, precious silver and gold
And pearls in oyster's flesh
Drop down we two to serve
And pray to love
Born again from the rhythm
Screaming down from Heaven
Ageless, ageless
I'm there in your arms
Don't wanna weep for you, don't wanna know
I'm blind and tortured, the white horses flow
The memories fire, the rhythms fall slow
Black Beauty, I love you so, so, so, oh
Oh, the welts of your scorn, my love, give me more
Send whips of opinion down my back, give me more
Well, it's you I've waited my life to see
It's you I've searched so hard for
Don't wanna weep for you, don't wanna know
I'm blind and tortured, the white horses flow
The memories fire, the rhythms fall slow
Black Beauty I love you so, so
Black, black, black, black, Black Beauty

And I was just a child then
What will you say
When you see my face?
Time feels like it's flown away
The days just pass and fade away
What will you say
When they take my place?
It's funny now
I just don't feel like I'm a man
What will you say
When you see my face?
My face...
Mother dear, the world's gone cold
No one cares about love anymore
What will you say
When you see my face?
Father do you hear me?
Do you know me?
Do you even care?
What will you say
When they take my place?
My heart can't take this anymore
What will you say
When you see my face?
When you see my
See my face...
I can feel your time crawling
To a slow end
I can feel my time crawling
To a slow end...
Mother dear, the world's gone cold
No one cares about love anymore
What will you say
When you see my face?
Father do you hear me?
Do you know me?
Did you even care?
What will you say
When you take my place?
Well it's so funny now
I just don't feel like I'm a man
What will you say?

None to blame or forgive
Two cripples dancing to the end we live
I'm not with you, but of you
Not with you, but of you
You are soft and young to me
I am the ghost who come and go
And I hope I'll catch you in the throes
One last look at the wonder
One last look at the wonder
Oh, God, I love you
And all the past we once knew
Some other love becomes you
Whatever else we come to
I know we could be so happy, baby
If we wanted to be
You are soft and young to me
I am the ghost who comes and goes
I'm hoping that I'll catch you in the throes
One last look at the joy that we've become
But there's no easy answer
None to blame or forgive
We were two cripples dancing
To the bitter end we live
I'm not with you, but of you
I'm not with you, but of you
Oh, God, I loved you
And all of the past we once knew
Some other love becomes you
Whatever else it comes to
I know we could be so happy, baby
If we wanted to be
We had a birthplace in common
We have separate beds and lives
Just sit here and gloat
Break out the oldest pictures
And hang your ruined letters out to dry
We had a birthplace in common
And separate beds and lives
I know we could be so happy, baby
If we wanted to be
I know we could be so happy, baby
If we wanted to be
Yeah, oh

The stone cold loner
And his eye's amazing
I'm a stone cold loner
As cool as a man could be
I was gigin' myself
When the love comes down on me
I let my bluebird
Fly on a cage
I sing a song for they've never gonna change the world, no
Let her fly away
Oh, let her fly away
I guess some lonesome chap
Who's waiting for you night and day
Bluebird is a liar
She'll never love you not for long
Bluebird's liar !
She never gonna love you long
She don't love you
But you know your best friend done before
I have an angel
With eyes like the ocean blue
I have an angel
With eyes like the ocean blue
Someday that bluebird
Is gonna fly away back to you
Angel, she's got a ??
Angel, angel sing a song
The rain is falling
And I believe my time has come
I let my bluebird
Fly on a cage
She'll pull , for the night to change or save the world
No, she's on bruising storm, angel
She's on a bruising storm
The rain is falling and I believe my time has come
My bluebird told me
I was a lover babe
Falling a mountain in another black bird cage
I said why
What was wrong with me
Why why why , what's wrong with me
What's you gonna do
Cos' there's a black bird picking out you see
Oh oh oh oh

I’ll do the
Just a bit of the first song that I ever heard by Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan
At a glance from the cup-bearer
I gulped the whole cup of wine in one
Draught and thus got intoxicated
O'divine mercy pardon my slip from
Grace as my eagerness for wine
Drinking pushed me in committing
This error
I could i dare to drink without
Permission! it was only a wink from
My sweetheart which prompted me to
Do so
O'holy man don't scoff at my apparent
Irreligiosity, i am the one with
His knack of chit-chat coaxed the
Divinity in granting me permission to
Drink
Dark clouds are hovering near and
Bring along the musicians'
Captivating notes
Who has spread her hair in the rainy
Season because the breeze is pregnant
With sweet fragrance?
Larks dance in the open tunes
Played by the clouds as they are
Bringing along their own playing
Instruments
The eyes of my sweetheart are so
Bewitchingly red that even the best wine of the tavern pales in
Comparison
Being coquettish my sweetheart
Sometimes comes very near to me and
At other time goes far away. but all the
Time she is close to my heart
Since the day my eyes met her lovely
Ones i am in perpetual state of slight
Intoxication
Her residence in my heart is
Comparable to a ray of light
Penetrating the pitch of darkness
This state of slight intoxication
Your love and your bewitching
Eyes have induced me to become
A drunkard
The whole universe is in a state
Of drunkeness; the day, the night
The dawn, the dusk, everything
Is perpetually intoxicated
Even the wine cup and wine
Bottle are drunk. And this is all a
Result of your bashful eyes
O'lovely cup-bearer although your
Repository contains all sorts of wines
But i am only fond of the wine that
Drips from your drowsy eyes
This state of slight intoxication
I don't know how to say prayers nor
Do i know the rites of ablution. i just
Prostrate myself before you whenever
I see you, because your worship and
Your love is my life
Right from creation i am the slave
Of love, and i don't care for belief
Or disbelief
My sweetheart, since i have found
You and have become the worshipper
At the alter of your love i don't require
A mosque to prostrate myself and say
My prayers
This slight state of intoxication
Even on the day of judgement when i
Am resurrected the scars of your love
Will be manifest on my body and your
Picture clinging to my heart
My extreme love of you has so
Elevated me spiritually that who ever i
Bow my heat it appears as if holy
Kaaba is in front of me
It does not behoove you to jeer and
Mock your disappointed lover
For god sake o'lovely one turn
Away your alluring eyes otherwise i
Will totally lose control of my heart
I pray to god that like me you also fall
In love with someone and then
Having been rebuffed in dejection you
Also roam about and lament the loss of your heart
To fall in love was a joke for me, but it
Has turned into a serious affair and
Now i am getting the punishment
While i am bewaiting the loss of
My heart why are you laughing
And making merry? What have
You gained out of it?
Raise your hands in prayer for me and
Be thankful of my friendship because it
Is i who has sharpened your charms
Thus turning you lovely being into a
Killer
O'darling of my heart bestow a glance
Of your lovely eyes at me, i am the
Same halfdead anwar who as mentor
And guide taught you to display
Captivating manners and charm
The people with your conversation

Some place better than where you've been
A coffee machine that needs some fixing
In a little café just around the bend
I'm calling you
Can't you hear me
I'm calling you
A hot dry wind blows right through me
The baby's crying and I can't sleep
But we both know a change is coming
Coming closer sweet release
I am calling you
I know you hear me
I am calling you oh

Got my red glitter coffin, man, just need one last nail
While all these ugly gentlemen play out their foolish games
There's a flaming red horizon that screams our names
And as your fantasies are broken in two
Did you really think this bloody road would pave the way for you?
You better turn around and blow your kiss hello to life eternal
Angel
Racist everyman, what have you done?
Man, you've made a killer of your unborn son
Oh crown my fear your king at the point of a gun
All I want to do is love everyone
And as your fantasies are broken in two
Did you really think this bloody road would pave the way for you?
You better turn around and blow your kiss hello to life eternal
There's no time for hatred, only questions
What is love, where is happiness, what is life, where is peace?
When will I find the strength to bring me release?
Tell me where is the love in what your prophet has said?
Man, it sounds to me just like a prison for the walking dead
I've got a message for you and your twisted hell
You better turn around and blow your kiss goodbye to life eternal
Angel yeah
Angel, unh, angel, unh

Looking out the door, I see the rain
Fall upon the funeral mourners
Parading in a wake of sad relations
As their shoes fill up with water
Maybe I'm too young
To keep good love from going wrong
But tonight you're on my mind
So you never know
Broken down and hungry for your love
With no way to feed it
Where are you tonight, child?
You know how much I need it
Too young to hold on
And too old to just break free and run
Sometimes a man gets carried away
When he feels like he should be having his fun
And much too blind to see the damage he's done
Sometimes a man must awake to find that really, he has no one
So I'll wait for you, and I'll burn
Will I ever see your sweet return?
Oh, will I ever learn?
Oh, oh, oh
Lover, you should've come over
'Cause it's not too late
Mhm
Lonely is the room, the bed is made
The open window lets the rain in
Burning in the corner is the only one
Who dreams he had you with him
My body turns and yearns
For a sleep that won't ever come
It's never over
My kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder
It's never over
All my riches for her smiles when I slept so soft against her
It's never over
All my blood for the sweetness of her laughter
It's never over
She's the tear that hangs inside my soul forever
Oh, but maybe I'm just too young
To keep good love from going wrong
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Lover, you should've come over
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yes, I, I feel too young to hold on
And much too old to break free and run
Too deaf, dumb, and blind to see the damage I've done
Sweet lover, you should've come over
How long will I wait for you?
Lover, lover, lover
Lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover
Lover, lover, lover, you should've come over
'Cause it's not too late

I'm a rolling stone, all alone and lost
For a life of sin, I have paid the cost
When I walk by, all the people say
"Just another boy down the lost highway"
Just a deck of cards and a jug of wine
And a woman's lies make a life like mine
Oh, the day we met, I went astray
I started rollin' down that lost highway
I was just a lad, nearly twenty-two
Neither good nor bad, just a kid like you
And now I'm lost, too late to pray
Lord, I've paid the cost on the lost highway
Now, boys, don't start your ramblin' round
On this road of sin or you're sorrow bound
Take my advice or you'll curse the day
You started rollin' down that lost highway

Drank it all in the morning
Waiting for the dark to move in
Sitting in my step-sister's kitchen
Horseflies on the window sill
Eyes trained on the lemon king
And wishing it were a gun
I'm thinking of our wedding rings
Trapped inside the heater
Spring water on the floor of this
Sex starved room
The nightmare's fires burn
The waves of bliss
I tried to stop it with my hand
I was lost in the kiss
With you
Mood swing whiskey
Your bliss, the actress
Bliss, the assassin
Bliss, the abyss
Did a crazy shot of whiskey
In about zero to sixty
All I could see was the beer
I face the future with a drink in my right
Eyes to the sparkling gloom
Body naked, afraid, and amazed
Say boost me up to your junkyard paradise
Boost me up to your junkyard paradise
With a sweet-ass photo of you
She cheated, and she lied, and you stole her
Stung my tongue just like
Sweat from her shoulder
Ooh, mood swing whiskey
Your love, the destroyer
Love, the destroyer
Love, love...
Yes mood swing whiskey has my brain
Only you can break this chain
Are you here in my bed again
Can you hear my love again (x4)
Run down the subway station babe
I'm packing my rod
All and present histories erased
I am a punishing god
Mood swing whiskey
Yeah the leaves are made of
Messy things again
And I said this is all the headless acrobats
Faces crushed in the circus dust
All for the law of gravity
And the price of admission
Beautiful loser warm hearts have let you down
Beautiful loser warm hearts have left you
Oh no, you...
I think of mankind in quotation marks
Ever since I took a drink from you
This is for all the headless acrobats
Faces crushed in the circus dust
All in the name of gravity
And the price of admission
Beautiful loser while eyes have let you now
Beautiful loser while eyes have let you now
Cause you're beautiful
I think of mankind in quotation marks
Ever since I took a drink of you

There's the moon asking to stay
Long enough for the clouds to fly me away
Well it's my time coming, I'm not afraid, afraid to die
My fading voice sings of love
But she cries to the clicking of time, oh, time
Wait in the fire, wait in the fire
Wait in the fire, wait in the fire
Fire
And she weeps on my arm
Walking to the bright lights in sorrow
Oh drink a bit of wine, we both might go tomorrow, oh my love
And the rain is falling and I believe my time has come
It reminds me of the pain I might leave, leave behind
Wait in the fire, wait in the fire
Wait in the fire, wait in the fire
Fire
(It reminds me of the pain)
I might leave, leave behind
Oh-oh
And I feel them drown my name
So easy to know and forget with this kiss
And I'm not afraid to go but it goes so slow
Oh, oh, yeah
Wait in the fire, wait in the fire
Oh, oh, oh, yeah-yeah
Wait in the fire, wait in the fire
Oh, wait, wait, wait
Wait in the fire, wait in the fire
Hey, wait
Wait in the fire, wait in the fire
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah

I feel the time is coming
I
I walk into your eyes
Oh
I don't care if the clock is turning
Cuz i'm going to the other side
You either die
Or you keep on burning alive
And i am burning
I
I walked a long long distance
I
I'm feeling sore inside
Oh
I don't care if the sky is falling
Cuz i'll never get to see the light
You either die
Or you keep on burning alive
And i am burning
And i am burning

Don't you wanna let go of your heart?
Or you'll resist the beds of bliss
Fortune makes fools of us all
My dear materialista, silence was insane
The parting was mutual
Don't you want the rocket to rock out?
There's room for us both to fly
Tell the man I'm never coming back again
Tell the man I'm never coming back again
Why should you notice at all?
Gone again beside you will fall
Down to the sea out of the skies
Of gold cards and casualties
I wanna come to see you shine
Feminine smiles the right side is wise, more than I
I wanna be your lover
Lipstick my name 'cross your mirror
Blood red with flaked gunshot glitter
And be one with all you disown in your young life
You paranoia politician diva
Yeah, you paranoia politician diva
Will you let go of your heart?
Left behind a hypnotizing swirl
The semi's left behind
Don't you want to rocket to rock?
There's room for both of us to fly
Same show everyday, don't have to blow up in the sky
So I just came from Hickstown
Left my coins behind
Maybe some poor clone's probably'll buy himself a line
Why should you care if I crash your affair?
Why should you notice me? I really wanna see you shine
I wanna be your lover
Lipstick my name across your mirror
Now, be one with all you disown
True love has come to us all
Blinded by the flame, right side smiles
Organized mail, love, my silence was insane
The parting was mutual the moment I became
A paranoia politician diva
A paranoia politician diva
Yeah, a paranoia politician diva
Yeah, a paranoia politician diva
Diva, diva, diva, diva

In an interview with NPR Jeff’s mother, Mary Guibert said Jeff idolised The Smiths:
Oh Mother, I can feel
The soil falling over my head
And as I climb into an empty bed
Oh well, enough said
I know it's over, still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Over, over
Oh Mother, I can feel
The soil falling over my head
You see the sea wants to take me
The knife wants to slit me
Do you think you can help me?
Sad-veiled bride, please be happy
Handsome groom, give her room
Loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly
Though she needs you
More than she loves you
I know it's over, still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Over, over
I know it's over
It never really began
But in my heart it was so real
And she even spoke to me and said, oh
"Well if you're so funny
Why are you on your own tonight?"
"And if you are so clever
Why are you on your own tonight?"
"And if you're so very entertaining
Why are you on your own tonight?"
"And if you're so very good looking
Why do you sleep alone tonight?"
I know: because tonight is just like any other night
That's why you're on your own tonight
With your triumphs and your charms
While they are in each other's arms
It's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate
It takes strength to be gentle and kind
Over, over, it's over, it's over
It's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate
It takes guts to be gentle and kind
Over, over
Love is natural and real
But not for you, my love, not tonight, my love
Love is natural and real
But not for such as you and I, my love
Oh Mother, I can feel
The soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can feel
The soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can feel
The soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can feel
The soil falling over my head
That's about it, let's go home
That was nice

I never asked to fly
Remember when you came to me
And told me of his lies
You didn't understand my love
You don't know why I try
And the rain was falling on that day
And damn the reason why
The Flying Pisces sails for time
And tells me of my child
Wrapped in bitter tales and heartache
He begs for just a smile
O he never asked to be her mountain
He never asked to fly
And through his eye he comes his love
And tells her not to cry
She says, "Your scoundrel father flies
With a dancer called a queen
And with her stolen cards he plays
And laughs, but never wins"
O the child dreams to be his hands
In the counting of the rain
But only barren breasts he feels
For her milk will never drain
As I die, I can't remember
Where I saw the rain
Could it be that her laughter
Drove me down again?
Charming dancer will you stop
Stop and talk to me?
Is there someone else you feel
In your dreams? you will, you see:
In midnight gazes
I've found you far from me:
If you lead me on
Please leave me down
Oh, Flying, Flying Fish
Please flutter by my door
Yes, you can drink my lies
If first you read my eyes:
Each one is titled
"I'm drowning back to you"
I can't swim your waters
And you can't walk my lands
I'm sailing all my sins
And I'm climbing all my fears
And soon now, I'll fly
My love is the flower that lies among the graves
My love is the thousand souls that each saves
And all the insane madmen tell me I am not a smoky haze
Lay me not in lands of men to spread my ash along the way
I want to feel the tide pull through me, like a women drunk in sin
I want to feel the fish swim through me. Let the water take my skin
Wrapped around the pebble that you choose to warm your hand
Just as I dream every day, as I pray you'll understand
Oh, I never asked to be your mountain
I never asked to fly
Remember when you came to me
And told me of his lies
You didn't understand my love
You don't know why I try
And the rain was falling on that day
And that's the reason why
Sweet lover, will you come back
And love me for a while?
Please take my hand
Leave all your fears behind
I've been gone too long
Now I'm home to stay
Please don't leave me
Again this way
Please come home

I want to tell you a story
About a little cutey
She's ass-slappin' pretty
And voluptuous fingers
Wanna let her lick me
Stick the thick of my pussy
From across the street
She looked good enough to eat... me!
Kitty!
Your flesh is nice
Your flesh is nice
Let me take a bite
Your flesh is so nice
Oh, I take off my belt
Oh, I whip the staircase (whip the staircase)
Oh, kill all the men
Everything's dead to them
You're the only one I follow
C'mon and lemme give you that "o"
Your flesh is nice (your flesh is so)
I wanna take you twice
Your flesh is nice
Ooh your flesh is nice
Your flesh is nice
Wanna take a bite
Your flesh is so
Your flesh is so
Your flesh is so
Your flesh is so (uhh)
Your flesh is so
Your flesh is so
Your flesh is so
Your flesh is so
Your flesh is so
Your flesh is so
Your flesh is so
Your flesh is so
Your flesh is so
Your flesh is so nice
Your flesh is so nice
Your flesh is so nice
Your flesh is so nice
Your flesh is so nice
Your flesh is so nice
Your flesh is so nice
Your flesh is so nice
Your flesh is so nice
Your flesh is so
Your flesh is so
Your flesh is so
(nice)
Your flesh is so
Your flesh is so (nice)
Your flesh is so
Your flesh is so (nice)
Your flesh is so (nice)
Your flesh is so (nice)
Your flesh is so (nice)

Looking out the door I see the rain fall upon the funeral mourners
Parading in a wake of sad relations as their shoes fill up with water
And maybe I'm too young to keep good love from going wrong
But tonight you are on my mind, so you never know
You never know
Every inch of me is full of pain, oh you should've come over
My broken bones can smell the rain and they're aching to be covered
And the rain, I wanna come down fast like kisses on my skin
But it passed me by and it left me dry
Oh, lover, you should've come over
Broken down and hungry for your love, with no way to feed it
Where're you tonight, child you know how much I need you
Too young to hold on and too old to break free and run
Oh, too old to run
Oh, lover, you should've come over
Will I wait? Will I burn?
Will I ever see your sweet return?
Oh lover you should've come over
Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah
Lonely is the room, the bed is made
Open window lets the rain in
Burning in the corner is the only one who wants you with him
My body turns and yearns for a sleep that will never come
It's never over, my kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder
It's never over, all my riches for her smiles
When I slept so soft against her
It's never over, all my blood for the memories
And the sweetness of her laughter
It's never over, she's the tear that hangs inside my soul forever
Or maybe I'm too young
To keep good love from going wrong
Oh lover, you should've come over
Will I wait? Will I burn?
Will I ever see your return?
Oh lover you should've come over, over, over

Since I ever was your star
Convinced that I am gone
Cause of what you are
But you know it was me
But you know it was me
I had a way to tell you
That you're in me now
But I imagine we are
In the pattern of our mind
I pretend that you trust me
I pretend that you trust me
Go on without you
Over the past we once you know
Some  other love becomes you
Whatever else it comes to
I know we could be so happy baby
If we wanted to bе
I don't want to lose you
But I can't ask that you stay
We all know it means
Your torturе anyway
But I'm thinking
In time you can trust me
All of the dislocation
That possessed me in you
Has always had a hold
The war I fight
Cause I love you
Cause I love you
So wrong without you
Out of the past we once you know
Some other love becomes you
Whatever else it comes to
I know we could be so happy baby
If we wanted to be
If we wanted
If we wanted
But you could be happy
We could grow and learn to forgive
The mistakes of tender souls in love
Who think they'll only live their life
With one home on face
Then I have another fairy tale
That I'm crushed in from me and you
Not with you but of you
Not with you but of you
Go home without you
Over the past we once you know
Some  other love becomes you
Whatever else it comes to
I know we could be so happy baby
If we wanted to be
I know we could be so happy baby
If we wanted to be

Well I heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do ya?
Well it goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall and the major lift
The baffled king composing "Hallelujah"
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Well, your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
And she tied you to her kitchen chair
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Well, baby, I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
You know, I used to live alone before I knew ya
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Well, there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me, do ya?
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Fall upon the funeral mourners
Parading in a wake of sad relations
As their shoes fill up with water
Well maybe I'm too young
To keep good love from going wrong
But tonight, you're on my mind
So, you never know
Broken  down and hungry for your love
With no way to feed it
Where are you tonight?
Child, you know how much I need it
Too young to hold on
And too old to just break free and run
Well, sometimes a man gets carried away
When he feels like he should be having his fun
Much to blind to see the damage he's done
You know, sometimes a man must awake to find that really
He has no one
So I'll wait for you
And yes, I'll burn
If I never see your sweet return
Oh will I ever learn
Oh lover, you should've come over
Cause it's not too late
Lonely is the room, the bed is made
The open window lets the rain in
Burning in the corner is the only one
Who dreams he had you with him
My body turns, and it yearns
For a sleep that won't ever come
It's never over
My kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder
It's never over
All my riches for her smiles when I slept so soft against her
Oh, it's never over
All my blood for the sweetness of her laughter
Oh, it's never over
She's the tear that hangs inside my soul forever
Oh, maybe I'm just too young
Yes I am
To keep good love from going wrong
I'll try to be better for you
Oh lover, you should've come over
I tried, but I feel to young to hold on
And I'm much too old to break free and run
Too deaf, dumb, and blind to see the damage I've done
Sweet lover, you should've come over
Over, over, over
Lover, lover, lover, you should've come over
Cause it's not too late

Flow into my ashen arms
Ice stream prick my sleeping skin
She is like the so black time
Race on in and never go away
She's just like this wind
Black Car, with your creaking wheel
Take away these thoughts of mine
Once there was a crazy man
Staring from his drunken eyes
Staring stony into her elbow's way
Stared at me and tellin' me
'Stead of 'oh, poor lonely me
I claw the bed and I claw my hair
Oh black car, with your creaking wheel
Take away these thoughts of mine
Pictures sing in rhythm with 'em
Dig the holes for me to sleep inside
She is free
A shadow crossing the sky
Free from hope and this misery
She's beautiful, so beautiful away from me
She is free
She is free
Instead of me is this creaking wheel
Take away these thoughts of mine
Pictures sing in rhythm with 'em
Dig the holes for me to sleep inside
Black car, with your creaking wheels
Take away these thoughts of mine
Catch us sing in rhythm with 'em
Dig both holes for me to sleep inside
She is free
Shadow crossing the sky
Free from hope and this misery
So beautiful away from me
She is free
She is free

So long ago, when I was small
All summer long it had a fair
Wonderful fair with swings and all
I used to love my little square
And at the close of everyday
I could be found, dancing around
A merry-go-round that used to play
'Ah, mon amour
A toi toujours
Dans tes grands yeux
Rien que nous deux'
All summer long my little fair
Made everyday like a holiday
Night after night it used to play
And people came there from so far away
And everyone sang that little tune
All around town you heard it played
Even Pepi from Napoli
He sang to Marie
This serenade
'Ah, mon amour
A toi toujours
Dans tes grands yeux
Rien que nous deux'
I can't forget my little square
Even though I'm so far away
I can't forget my little fair
Maybe it's still there, still there today
I sometimes hear that little tune
Playing in a dream of long ago
And in my brain runs the refrain
That old French refrain I used to know
'Ah, mon amour
A toi toujours
Dans tes grands yeux
Rien que nous deux'

This is our last goodbye
I hate to feel the love between us die
But it's over, just hear this and then I'll go
You gave me more to live for, more than you'll ever know
Well, this is our last embrace
Must I dream and always see your face?
Why can't we overcome this wall?
Baby, maybe it's just because I didn't know you at all
Kiss me, please kiss me
Kiss me out of desire, baby, not consolation
Oh, you know it makes me so angry 'cause I know that in time
I'll only make you cry, this is our last goodbye, oh
Oh no, no, no
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh
Did you say, "No, this can't happen to me"?
Did you rush to the phone to call?
Was there a voice unkind in the back of your mind
Saying, "Maybe, you didn't know him at all"?
You didn't know him at all, oh, oh, you didn't know
Ooh, didn't know
Well, the bells out in the church tower chime
Burning clues into this heart of mine
Thinking so hard on her soft eyes
And the memories offer signs that it's over
It's over

This is our last goodbye
I hate to feel the love between us die
But it's over, just hear this and then I'll go
You gave me more to live for, more than you'll ever know
Well, this is our last embrace
Must I dream and always see your face?
Ooh I can't we overcome this wall?
Maybe it's just because I didn't know you at all
Kiss me, please kiss me
Kiss me out of desire, I'm not consolation
You know it makes me so angry cause I know that in time
I'll only make you cry, this is my last goodbye, ohhh
Ooooh
Ooooh
Ooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
What did you say, "No, this can't happen to me!"
Did you rush to the phone to call
Was there a voice unkind
In the back of your mind
Saying may-be
You didn't know him at all oooh ooooh
Ooohh goodbye
Ooohh yeah yeah
Ooohh babe
Ooohh yeah yeah yeah
Oohh yeah
Oh my last
My last
My last goodbye

My eyes are a baptism
Oh, I am fuse
And sing her into my thoughts
Oh, phantom elusive thing
Oh, all flowers in time bend towards the sun
I know you say that there's no-one for you
But here is one
All flowers in time bend towards the sun
I know you say that there's no-one for you
But here is one
But here is one
Here is one
Aaah
La, da, da-da
Aaah
Oh, all flowers in time bend towards the sun
I know you say that there's no-one for you
But here is one
All flowers in time bend towards the sun
I know you say that there's no-one for you
But here is one
But here is one
Keep it going in me
Wicked traveller
Fading farther from me
With your face in my window glow
Oh, where will you weep for me?
Sweet willow
It's ok to be angry
But not to hurt me
Your happiness
Yes, yes, yes
Darling, darling, darling
Oooh...
All flowers in time bend towards the sun
I know you say that there's no one for you
But here is one
All flowers in time bend towards the sun
I know you say that there's no one for you
But here is one
All flowers in time bend towards the sun
I know you say that there's no one for you
But here is one
All flowers in time bend towards the sun
I know you say that there's no one for you
But here is one
But here is one
But here is one

Now I-I-I want someone badly
Got a girl here tonight wants someone new

And jump the hedges first
And I will drink the clear
Clean water for to quench my thirst
And I shall watch the ferry-boats
And they'll get high, high, high
On a bluer ocean
Against tomorrow's sky
And I will never ever grow so old again
And we will walk and talk
In gardens all misty wet with rain
Oh, sweet thing, sweet thing
My, my, my, my, my sweet thing
And I will drive my chariot
Down your streets and cry
Hey, it's me, i'm dynamite
And I don't know why
And you will hold me strongly
In your arms again
Pretty babe, I will not remember
That I ever felt the pain
And we will walk and talk
In gardens all misty wet with rain
And I will never, ever
Grow so old again
Oh, sweet thing
My, my, my, my, my sweet thing
Sweet thing
And I will raise my hand up into the midnight sky
And count all the lights that shining up in your eye
Just to dig it all and not to question, well that's just fine
Just to dig it all and never wonder, well that's just fine
And I'll be satisfied not to read between the lines
And we will walk and talk
In gardens all misty wet with rain
You know we will, some day
We, you and me, will walk and talk
In gardens all misty wet with rain
Oh, you and me, we will walk and talk
In gardens all misty wet with rain
We will walk in gardens all misty wet with rain
And we shall walk in gardens all misty wet with rain
We shall walk and talk
In gardens all misty wet with rain
And we will never ever grow so old again
Oh, sweet thing
Oh, sweet thing
Sweet thing, you know we will
Oh, you know we will
Remember the day that I held your hand
And the look in my eyes only you can understand
Remember when we held each other soft and low
And nothing can ever be that strong
Sleep tonight with dreams of sweetest angels' wings
And all your dreams will bring you sweeter things
Sweet, sweet, sweet thing
Oh, sweet thing, don't you know
Come here, let me tell you how much I love you
Sweet thing, oh, sweet thing
You know we will walk and talk
In gardens all misty wet with rain
And we will never grow so old again
Oh, sweet thing

Streetlights flicker on, as they take on the sun
Like counterfeit stars
Watch them come
Watch them come
The pacified hate's full-speed away
A company in the arms of a decorative grave
No tears, no fears
You'll always remain here
The power out there seems to keep you in
Lost your blood to adrenaline
The flesh is weak and the dream is within
And in the plastic room
Seven little honey girls sitting in a row
Pratise for the imperial pillow
Like sweet little strawberries eaten from a bowl
Hot, lipstick red
In a candy store sold
And in the bed I stared
Do you hear destiny?
Girl, animal scream
Nightmarey shade, strawberry tile
Drinking for hours alone
Kill memory, watch it die
Pornographic, dead, fucking ripped and bloody
Shredded steaming mess
Kill the memories, watch them die
Lullaby, your mother's once son
Yours is the kind 's born to die young
And on the boulevard, seven little honey girls
Sitting in a row
Manicled to the imperial pillow
And if I came up there to Strawberry Street
It said that I held the key
Would you do as I told you?
Would you give it up to me, automatically?
Strawberry, strawberry....what you gonna do for me?
Strawberry, strawberry....what you gonna do for me?
Strawberry, strawberry....what you gonna do for me?
Strawberry, strawberry....what you gonna do for me?
Strawberry, strawberry....what you gonna do for me?
Strawberry, strawberry....what you gonna do for me?

Sleeping with his arms ‘round the hips of fate
And his tears scattered ‘round the world
Angel, go give him his dreams
And my cold, black visions
Show him his babies in a helpless state
Of never knowing fully his voice
Never knowing what it is to be
His children
Dream brother
With his eyes to the burning sun
Don't be like the one who made me so old
Don't be like the one who left behind his name
'Cause they're waiting for you like I waited for mine
And nobody ever came
Don't be like the one who made me so old
Don't be like the one who left behind his name
'Cause they're waiting for you like I waited for mine
And nobody ever came
Don't be like the one who made me so old
Don't be like the one who left behind his name
'Cause they're waiting for you like I waited for mine
And nobody ever came
Nobody ever came

Southern trees bear a strange fruit
Blood on the leaves and blood at the root
Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze
Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees
Pastoral scene of the gallant south
The bulging eyes and the twisted mouth
Scent of magnolias, sweet and fresh
Then the sudden smell of burning flesh
Here is fruit for the crows to pluck
For the rain to gather, for the wind to suck
For the sun to rot, for the trees to drop
Here is a strange and bitter crop

You and I
Ah, the calm below that poisoned river wild
You and I
Tears that dry on a rude awakened child
Where you look down
I've walked before, burning holes
With eyes of liquid brown
If we had only known, in a way
We wouldn't reach this ground
You were my only home, silver eyes
I want to see you shine
And we will feel the weight
Fall away from us in time
Searching our past for the true
You and I, you and I, you and I
All for you
Where you think you'll fall
I adore you
Where you shut your soul
I will open for you
If we had only known, in a way
We'd never reach this ground
I'll know, silver eyes
I can see us shine
I said, we will feel the weight
Fall away from us in time
Searching our past for a true
You and I, you and I, you and I
All for you

Oooh, fall in light, fall in light, fall in light
Fall in light
Feel no shame for what you are
Feel no shame for what you are
Feel no shame for what you are
Feel no shame for what you are
Feel no shame for what you were
As the marrow in your bones
Fall in light
Feel no shame for what you are
Feel no shame for what you are
Feel it as a waterfall
Fall in light
Oooh, fall in light, fall in light, fall in light
Oooh, fall in light, fall in light, fall in light
Grow in light
Stand absolved
Behind your electric chair, dancing
Stand absolved
Behind your electric chair, dancing
Past the sound within the sound
Past the voice within the voice
Leave your office, run past your funeral
Leave your home, car, leave your pulpit
Join us in the streets where we
Join us in the streets where we
Don’t belong, don’t belong
Here under the stars
Throwing light, oooh
Fall
Oooh, fall in light, fall in light, fall in light
Oooh, fall in light, fall in light, fall in light
Grow in light

Twenty-nine pearls in your kiss, a singing smile
Coffee smell, and lilac skin, your flame in me
Twenty-nine pearls in your kiss, a singing smile
Coffee smell, and lilac skin, your flame in me
I'm only here for this moment
I know everybody here wants you
I know everybody here thinks they need you
I'll be waiting right here just to show you
How our love will blow it all away
Such a thing of wonder in this crowd
I'm a stranger in this town, you're free with me
And our eyes are locked in downcast love
I sit here proud
Even now you're undressed in your dreams with me
I'm only here for this moment
I know everybody here wants you
I know everybody here thinks he needs you
I'll be waiting right here just to show you
How our love will blow it all away
And all the tears we cried have dried on yesterday
A sea of fools have parted for us, there's nothing in our way, my love
Don't you see? Don't you see?
You're just the torch to put the flame to all our guilt and shame
And I'll rise like an ember in your name
No, no
I know everybody here wants you (No)
I know everybody here thinks they need you
I'll be waiting right here just to show you
Oh, let me show you that love can rise just like embers
Love can taste like the wine of the age, oh, babe
And I know they all look so good from a distance
But I tell you I'm the one
I know everybody here well thinks he needs you, thinks he need you
And I'll be waiting right by here just to show you

Angel divine
Angel milk what's your ilk
Angel bilk
Angel cash Angel Smash
Angel hash

And back along the lane again
There in the sunshine
In the sweet summertime
Oh the way that young lovers do
I kissed you on the lips once more
We said goodbye at your front door
There in the night time
Love, that's the right time
Oh to feel the way that young lovers do
And we sat on our own star
And dreamed of the way that we were
And the way that we wanted to be
And we sat on our own star
And dreamed of the way that I was for you
And that you were for me
And then we long to dance the night away
Turned to each other, saying 'I love you, baby I love you'
Oh the way that young lovers do
Lovers do
Do, do, do, do
The way young lovers do
Do, do, do, do
The way young lovers do
And we sat on our own star
And dreamed of the way that we were
And the way that we wanted to be
And we sat on our own star
And dreamed of the way that I was for you
And you were for me
Oh baby, baby
And then we long to dance the night away
And turned to each other, saying 'I love you, baby I love you'
Oh the way
I held her with her looking down
And I kissed her
With the snow falling down
In the street light
It was a sweet light
And the way that young
Oh, the way that young lovers
Oh the way that young
That young lovers
That young lovers

Time takes care of the wound
So I can believe
You had so much to give
You thought I couldn't see
Gifts for boot heels to crush
Promises deceived
I had to send it away
To bring us back again
Your eyes and body brighten
Silent waters, deep
Your precious daughter
In the other room, asleep
A kiss goodnight
From every stranger that I meet
I had to send it away
To bring us back again
Morning theft
Unpretender left
Ungrateful
True self is what brought you here to me
A place where we can accept this love
Friendship battered down by useless history
Unexamined failure
What am I still to you?
Some thief who stole from you?
Or some fool drama queen
Whose chances were few?
Love brings us to who we need
A place where we can save
A heart that beats as both
Siphon and reservoir
You're a woman, I'm a calf
You're a window, I'm a knife
We come together
Making chance into starlight
Meet me tomorrow night
Or any day you want
I have no right to wonder
Just how, or when
You know the meaning fits
There's no relief in this
I miss my beautiful friend
I had to send it away
To bring her back again
