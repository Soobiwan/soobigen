Seeing you was so bittersweeet I almost died
My heart jumped but my head kept screaming: why?
And I almost thought that I could change the past
And I almost, but that never really lasts
Oh
And I'm shot
Oh, baby, I'm shot
But I'm not
Whatever you wanted
Forever just wanting
You
And I hope you notice
And could come around
'Cause I always blow it
And run it into the ground
And silence keeps me frozen
And you won't make a sound
So I hope you notice
Screaming man down
You know how everyone's always saying "Seize the moment?"
I don't know, I... I'm kinda thinking it's the other way around
You know, like, the moment seizes us
And I'll only say this one time
Your headlines won't get none of my time
Yeah, I'm lying
'Cause I still can't find out
Why I'm so divided
Replay those few days over
Somehow I'll find it
Somewhere in your words
When you leant on my shoulder
I might act distant, but I swear that it's not over
I don't want to hear it
But I gotta know, yeah I just gotta know
Is there a reason, do you care if I'm still breathing?
Or am I insane
For thinking we could've made it?
Oh, baby, we could've made it
Oh, baby, I'm shot
But I'm not
Whatever you wanted
Forever just wanting
You
But you'll never know it
'Cause I'm just way too proud
Hide behind my ego
Block the whole world out
And these words they don't come easy
And they don't come loud
So you'll never know it
Screaming man down
I just saw God
I just saw God
Outside the liquor store
He told me I was lost
Lost

Which would be worse: to live as a monster or to die as a good man?



Before the EP released EDEN asked on Soundcloud if his fans would rather have this or “tell me” on the EP, Woah ended up making it into the tracklist.Yeah, woah, no no
I know, I
Just give me a reason
Give me a lifeline
Not everything's easy
They were your words, not mine
So I'll be your reason
And you could be mine
'Cause we are just lost inside your head
Yet somehow I wake up in your bed
But I don't want you to become
Anything or everything, oh
'Cause I'm an off and on hook up
'Cause I can't survive without your love
If it even exists
If it even exists
Does it even exist?
Does it even?
So I'll be your reason
We won't talk again
I made you fall slowly
By not giving in
And we are the reason
They write love songs so sad
Dream of another end, oh
Woah, no no no
Woah, no
No, no no no
Would you believe it?
Could you believe it?
Would you believe it?
Would you...
Oh

Statues is the third song in The Eden Project’s EP titled “Kairos”.
I'll break the silence
And watch it fall to pieces
The aftermath of passive violence
The he said that she said she did
And oh
I got a feeling I think you should know
I'm trying to find hope, there's nothing left to hold
I'm stuck down here in this hole, I'll dig my way out
I'll stand just like a statue, just like you
Acting like the sky's just about to fall
With everything I can't do, I can't move
In the end I'll find my way back home
(Find myself at home)
Just say something
Don't leave me here with nothing
I know I deserve more than this
Self destruction, I'll think 'til I can't function
I should have seen it coming to this
They say it's not having this
And you're one shot till it's all over
Say it, I just want out
Just let your words wash over me
And oh, a sinking feeling
The flash fire's gone out
I'm trying to find hope, there's nothing left to hold
I'm stuck down here in this hole, I'll dig my way out
I'll stand just like a statue, just like you
Acting like the sky's just about to fall
With everything I can't do, I can't move
In the end I'll find my way back home
(Find myself at home)
Just say something, don't leave me here with nothing
I know I deserve more than this
Self destruction, I'll think 'til I can't function
I should have seen it coming to this
And every second I breathe, I'm coming closer
With every day that I see, I'm getting older
With every step that I take, I'm moving further
Away from what I am, and who I was
Let go of yourself, like you let go of me
(And every second I breathe, I'm coming closer)
You were my oxygen, and now it's hard to breathe
(With every day that I see, I'm getting older)
This is the final page, so now I'll set you free
(With every step that I take, I'm moving further)
You were my everything, I was your empathy
(Away from what I am, and who I was)
I'll take the blame if you take my conscience
Let go of yourself, like you let go of me
(And every second I breathe, I'm coming closer)
I'll take the blame if you take my conscience
You were my oxygen, and now it's hard to breathe
(With every day that I see, I'm getting older)
I'll take the blame if you take my conscience
This is the final page, so now I'll set you free
(With every step that I'm take, I'm moving further)
I'll take the blame if you take my conscience
You were my everything, I was your empathy
(Away from what I am, and who I was)
I'll stand just like a statue, just like you
Acting like the sky's just about to fall
With everything I can't do, I can't move
In the end I'll find my way back home
Just say something, don't leave me here with nothing
I know I deserve more than this
Self destruction, I'll think 'til I can't function
I should have seen it coming to this
I'll take the blame if you take my conscience
Let go of yourself, like you let go of me
(And every second I breathe, I'm coming closer)
I'll take the blame if you take my conscience
You were my oxygen, and now it's hard to breathe
(With every day that I see, I'm getting older)
I'll take the blame if you take my conscience
This is the final page, so now I'll set you free
(With every step that I take, I'm moving further)
I'll take the blame if you take my conscience
You were my everything, I was your empathy
(Away from what I am, and who I was)
Take the blame if you take my conscience
(Let go of yourself, like you let go of me)
(And every second I breathe, I'm coming closer)
I'll take the blame if you take my conscience
(You were my oxygen, and now it's hard to breathe)
(With every day that I see, I'm getting older)
I'll take the blame if you take my conscience
(This is the final page, so now I'll set you free)
(With every step that I'm take, I'm moving further)
(You were my everything, I was your empathy)
(Away from what I am, and who I was)
Let go of yourself, like you let go of me
You were my oxygen, and now it's hard to breathe
This is the final phase, so now I'll set you free
You were my everything, I was your empathy



Karma

As your best friend
Did I ever think of you
I'm not complaining
I never tried to feel
I never tried to feel this vibration
I never tried to reach
I never tried to reach your eden
Did I ever think of you
As my enemy
Did you ever think of me
I'm complaining
I never tried to feel
I never tried to feel this vibration
I never tried to reach
I never tried to reach your eden

Now it's over
It's out of my hands
And now I'm older
I can breathe easy again
And it was so close
I couldn't bear to even open my eyes
Life's a cruel joke
'Cause no one leaves here alive
Time changes everything
And time is all we have
'Cause I went chasing everything
And I lost my mind instead
Everything, everything

Asleep since last September, but was it all a dream?
But now it feels like the sun is on our side, side.
But I still feel like I'm always just a step behind you, but.
Oh, if you let me in I could be the one.
Baby steps but oh,
If you let me in I could be the one.
'Cus, we're better together.
We're better together.
We're better together.
You and I.
We're better together.
We're better together.
We're better together.
You and I.
Just give me time.
We'll make it if it's right.
I swore I'd never fall again.
Tables turn,
But without mistakes we'll never learn.
And if we just let go we'll learn to love again.
('Cus, We're better together)
I want your everything just give it all don't hold back.
I'll take this whole world on and leave it all in my tracks.
The more you see the less you know I want to forget.
I'll never say die, 'cus I haven't lived yet.



Turn the lights off in this place
And she shines just like a star
And I swear I know her face
I just don't know who you are
Turn the music up in here
I still hear her loud and clear
Like she's right there in my ear
Telling me that she wants to own me
To control me
Come closer
Come closer
And I just can't pull myself away
Under her spell I can't break
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
And I just can't bring myself no way
But I don't want to escape
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
I can feel her on my skin
I can taste her on my tongue
She's the sweetest taste of sin
The more I get the more I want
She wants to own me
Closer
And she shines just like a star
And I just can't pull myself away
Under her spell I can't break
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
And I just can't bring myself no way
But I don't want to escape
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
Come closer
Closer
And she shines just like a star

The morning light shines a lifeline
Escape is what I need
I should've listened last night, girl
This is beyond belief
That we keep falling for the lure of
Liquid confidence and lies
And we skydive from walls we built
Dying just to feel alive
On the way down screamin'
Whoa
If all we have is time, then we'll be alright
It's not much, but it's better than nothing (Whoa)
We're running on fumes, but we'll make it through the night
It's not love, but it's better than dreaming
Oh, I'm on fire
There's a burning in my bones and in my eyes
These dreams, they're taking hold, I just need time
Time
Boy, you're in a hurry
If you were lookin' at what I'm looking at, you'd be in a hurry too
Whoa
If all we have is time, then we'll be alright (Whoa)
It's not much, but it's better than nothing (Whoa)
We're running on fumes, but we'll make it through the night (Whoa)
It's not love, but it's better than dreaming
Whoa
If all we have is time, then we'll be alright (Whoa)
It's not much, but it's better than nothing (Whoa)
We're running on fumes, but we'll make it through the night (Whoa)
It's not love, but it's better than dreaming

Say something, I'm giving up on you
I'll be the one, if you want me to
Anywhere, I would've followed you
Say something, I'm giving up on you
And I am feeling so small
It was over my head
I knew nothing at all
And I will stumble and fall
I'm still learning to love
Just starting to crawl
But say something, I'm giving up on you
I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you
And anywhere, I would've followed you
Say something, I'm giving up on you, oh
And I will swallow my pride
You're the one that I love
I'm saying goodbye
And I will stumble and fall
I'm still learning to love
Just starting to crawl
Say something, I'm giving up on you
I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you
And anywhere, I would've followed you
Just say something, I'm giving up on you
And I am feeling so small
It was over my head
I know nothing at all
Say something, I'm giving up on you
And I'll be the one if you want me to

Jupiter tells the story of Ng’s heartbreaking disappointment over an unloving love.
Can you hear me out this time, just a minute let me find my thoughts
'Cause I can't think straight in the silence
And Jupiter ain't seen a storm like this, no
'Cause it's so hard out on the sidelines
When I just want to blow this ten miles wide
And I can't help but keep on thinking
These thoughts are gonna bury me alive
But this jealousy won't get the best of me
Maybe if I just had more patience I could be
So far from here
And the stars, they'll guide me home
When I falter
And everything comes crumbling down
'Cause it does and it will
It's not heaven
But we got so close
In the aftermath, this vacuum's lifeless
The afterglow makes the past so inviting
Oh no
I hear them say that I'm caught up with my head lost and found
But I know exactly where I wish I was, if I could only
Just keep on moving 'cause I got a vision
If I can I'm running to wherever I gotta go
I'm sorry I gotta go
But these words lose their meaning
'Cause I just keep repeating them like that'll make them come alive
But they're only words and you know it
You've always known better than I do
And it feels like I know nothing but envy
Maybe if I just had more patience I would be
So far from here
And the stars, they'll guide me home
When I falter
And everything comes crumbling down
'Cause it has and it will
You're no angel
But we got so close
You liar
And I fell for every word
Who knew?
You lied
But maybe I wanted you to
Who knew?
Who knew?

It's arguments at crossroads
No, I don't drive slow
But it's better than not moving at all
And you could let the top blow
Or just see how it is 'cause it ain't long until there's nothing at all
And I saw you flip
Got your end game wrapped 'round your trigger finger's fingertip
But if you pull it, I'm gone
So just breathe it, breathe in
'Cause if you're not looking, then you're never gonna find it
And if we're not trying, then we're never gonna fly this
But you don't have to say it
'Cause I'm leaving here (Woah, woah oh)
Yeah, I'm leaving here (Woah, woah oh)
Yeah, I'm leaving here
Right now
And this world is screaming out
So far from here (Woah, woah oh)
No, I don't know where I'm going, but I know I'm gone
It's arguments at crossroads
No, I don't drive slow
But it's better than, better than at all
And you could let the top blow
Or just see how it is
'Cause it ain't long until there's nothing at all
And I saw you flip
Got your end game wrapped 'round your trigger finger's fingertip
But if you pull it, I'm gone
So just breathe it, breathe it, breathe in
'Cause if you're not looking, then you're never gonna find it
And if we're not trying, then we're never gonna fly this
But you don't have to say it
'Cause I'm leaving here
'Cause I'm leaving here
'Cause I'm leaving here
Right now
I can't just let this go
And though it's hard, I'll find my way back home
'Cause I'm leaving here (Woah, woah oh)
Yeah, I'm leaving here (Woah, woah oh)
Yeah, I'm leaving here
Right now
And this world is screaming out
So far from here (Woah, woah oh)
No, I don't know where I'm going, but I know I'm gone

Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, oh no, no
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, oh no
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, oh no, no
No, no
I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave I'm begging you not to go
Call your name two, three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
'Cause I know I don't understand
How your love can do what no one else can
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now
You got me hoping you'll page me right now
Your kiss, you got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy, your love, you got me looking
Got me looking so crazy, love
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, oh no, no
Uh-oh, uh-oh, yeah, yeah
When I talk to my friends so quietly
"Who he think he is?" look at what you did to me
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't there ain't nobody else to impress
It's the way that you know what I thought I knew
It's like a beat in my heart skips when I'm with you
But I still don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now
Got me hoping you'll page me right now
Your kiss, you got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy, your love, you got me looking
Got me looking so crazy, your love
Young Hov, y'all know when the flow is loco (Got me looking)
(So crazy, my baby) Young B and the R-O-C, oh no
O.G. big homie, the one and only (I'm not myself lately)
Stick bony, but the pockets is fat like Tony Soprano (I'm foolish, I don't do this)
(I've been playing myself) The ROC handle like Van Exel (Baby, I don't care)
I shake phonies man you can't get next to
Your love's got the best of me
Baby, you're makin' a fool of me
You got me sprung and I don't care who sees
'Cause baby you got me, you got me, you got me
Oh, baby, you got me, you got me, you got me
Woah (Yeah)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (Yeah)
Got me looking so crazy right now (Yeah)
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (Yeah)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now
Your kiss, you got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy, your love, you got me looking
Got me looking so crazy, your love
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, oh no, no
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, oh no
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, oh no, no, oh
No, no, oh

I just want you
The words I never said
But wanted to
I'm losing you
I'm losing you
But these thoughts won't let you go
They keep running back to you
(Chasing ghosts)
(Chasing ghosts)
(Chasing ghosts)
(Chasing ghosts)
I just want you (Chasing ghosts)
I just want you (Chasing ghosts)
I just want you (Chasing ghosts)
(Chasing chasing)
And I'm bleeding words
They escape me, the recoil, it hurts
And I can't look the other way
I'm chasing starlight to find it's died away
Breathe it in
It's just snow
We're just falling
And we won't always free fall
Back to nothing
'Cause I'm just starting to learn
I've always been chasing ghosts
I just want you
I just want you
I just want you
I just want you
I just want you
I just want you
(Chasing ghosts)
(Chasing ghosts)
(Chasing ghosts)
(Chasing ghosts)
(Chasing ghosts)
(Chasing ghosts)
(Chasing chasing)



Explosions in my chest, 'cause I can feel it in my bones
Forget the words you said, I don't need 'em anymore
I got it planned out in my head and I won't stop until it's done, no
Here we are, again
Just hear me out, again
And now I'm falling through the sky, and I can't find my peace of mind
I think I'm falling, I think I'm falling
If you could see through my point of view, and it keeps leading back to you
'Cause I'm just falling, I think I'm falling, yeah
Here we are, again, just hear me out, again
And now I'm falling through the sky, and I can't find my peace of mind
I think I'm falling, I think I'm falling
If you could see through my point of view, and it keeps leading back to you
'Cause I'm just falling, I think I'm falling, yeah
Falling through the sky, 'cause I can't find my peace of mind
I think I'm falling, I just keep falling

I forgot
Everything
From the first thought
To the last dreams
When it's so wrong
And you can’t breathe
It's the thoughts inside that will change you
Just say no
Never let it go
You can't run from yourself, that’s all that you know
And time's ticking away, the light will slowly fade
And we will fall through the changes
So just say yes
A leap of faith, I guess
We are the ones who were chased until the final breath
Life's ticking away, the light will slowly fade
And we will fall through the changes

Tonight the city is ours
We've got that fight in our hearts
And you just never know if you never try
Beat, broken and flawed
Our backs to the wall
We're growing, we're growing
Tonight the city is ours
We've got that fight in our hearts
And you just never know if you never try
Beat, broken and flawed
Our backs to the wall
We're growing
Dying to fallout
Dying to fallout
Just trying to fallout
Dying to fallout
Dying to fallout
Dying to fallout
Just trying to fallout
Dying to fallout
Dying to fallout
Dying to fallout
Just trying to fallout
Dying to fallout
Ashes to ashes, we all fall down
Last year's a memory, it's over now
Bright lights will blind us till they all blur out
There's no stopping us now
Tonight the city is ours
We've got that fight in our hearts
And you just never know if you never try
Beat, broken and flawed
Our backs to the wall
We're growing
Dying to fallout
Dying to fallout
Just trying to fallout
Dying to fallout
Dying to fallout
Dying to fallout
Just trying to fallout
Dying to fallout
Dying to fallout
Dying to fallout
Just trying to fallout
Dying to fallout

It's alright
And when you're sober
Maybe you'll think twice
And now it's over
You've gotta realize
The sun is setting
On your paradise
Spitfire to dreams
They go higher
And damned is all I have
A ghost
And I'm dying to try
to die trying, I'll fade
And by smiling, you
cannot finally think
That you were owned by me
Cos I'm bleeding; this heart,
it ain't healing
At times, I can't feel if it's right
There's no feeling at all
Spitfire to dreams
They go higher
And you cannot finally think
That you were owned-, owned-, ...
I just wanna-
I just wanna-

I'm jealous of the rain
That falls upon your skin
It's closer than my hands have been
I'm jealous of the rain
I'm jealous of the wind
That ripples through your clothes
It's closer than your shadow
Oh, I'm jealous of the wind
'Cause I wished you the best of
All this world could give
And I told you when you left me
There's nothing to forgive
But I always thought you'd come back, and tell me all you found was
Heartbreak and misery
And it's hard for me to say, I'm jealous of the way
You're happy without me
And I'm jealous of the nights
That I don't spend with u
I'm wonderin' who you lay next to
Oh, I'm jealous of the night
Oh I'm jealous of the love
The love that was in here
Was gone for someone else to share
Oh, I'm jealous of the love
'Cause I wished you the best of
All this world could give
And I told you when you left me
There's nothin' to forgive
But I always thought you'd come back, and tell me all you found was
Heartbreak and misery
It's hard for me to say, I'm jealous of the way
You're happy without me
As I sink in the sand
Watch you slip through my hands
Oh, as I die here another day
Cause all I do is cry behind this smile
I wished you the best of
All this world could give
And I told you when you left me
There's nothing to forgive
But I always thought you'd come back, tell me all you found was
Heartbreak and misery
And it's hard for me to say, I'm jealous of the way
You're happy without me
It's hard for me to say, I'm jealous of the way
You're happy without me

Today we got an encore, encore
And tell me do you scream?
Even when every thing's a nightmare
It's something we had seen
'Cause we let everyone we love fall down
Like a lead sky in the night
And it's all we are
'Cause we get off on everything we are
So tell me you love me
I will too
So tell me you loath me
I do too
And tell me that you love me

I'm never gonna break
I'll never fucking break
I'm never gonna break
I'll never fucking break
And it all comes crashing down
Like the words that we never found
We're addicted to drama
It's the first signs of trauma
The things only I know
I just keep waiting for kairos
Although we got no hope
We hold on
It gets worse before it's better
I won't go
I'm not done
This is not the time
I'll hold my tongue
Cause we could find another reason
So we can fall apart again
And we'll go running back in circles
Waiting on perfection till the end
And it all comes crashing down
Like the words that we never found
We're addicted to drama
It's the first signs of trauma
The things only I know
This is kairos

Can't you feel it?
Everything is so beautiful and lovely
And
And alive
You, you shouldn't say anything about anything not being
This is reality, this is
If you look right over there
Are you looking? Can you
Yes, what should I say?
I wish I could talk in technicolor or
Or let you see, can you
Did you say you can see it?
No, I can't quite see it
Tell me about it
It's
I can't tell you about it
If you can't see it then you'll just never know it
I feel sorry for you
Can't you feel it?
How do you feel?
Tell me
Alive

You know how I feel
The sun in the sky
You know how I feel
And breeze, that keep drifting on by
You know how I feel
It's a new dawn, it's a new day
It's a new life for me
Yeah, I'm feeling good
Fish in the sea
You know how I feel
River running free
You know how I feel
And blossom in the tree, oh
You know how I feel
It's a new dawn, it's a new day
It's a new life for me
I'm feeling good
I'm feeling good
Dragonfly out in the sun
You know what I mean, don't you know?
And butterflies all having fun
You know what I mean
And sleeping geese when the day is done
You know what I mean
And this whole world is a new world,
is a bold world for me
Stars when you shine
You know how I feel
And scent of the pine
You know how I feel
And freedom is mine
And I know how I feel
It's a new dawn, it's a new day
It's a new life for me
Ooh, ooh...
And I'm feeling good

It's been a long, long time
We've come a long, long way
No, I can't see the finish line
Scared half to death but that's okay
It's been a long long night
After a long long day
My body's aching but I know somehow
My feet will find a way
So I'll sing it loud in the silence
And give the best of me
'Til it's alright, but not over
I will find fight like a soldier
Coming home, in the silence
But I have never felt so free
The future's so bright, this is our time
I'ma live it how I dream
It's been a long, long time
Since I've seen sunlight through the rain
Since I've felt love or truth, It's strange
But I left bliss back where I came
And I won't lie
It's taken so long to feel okay
And now the world is screaming out for more
But I don't feel the same
But we'll be alright
'Cause it's all we know
And it's only change
Sun sets on the old
But we're nocturnal anyway
And this is how we know
It'll be okay
These are the times we will hold
When our memories fade
'Cause it's all we know
And it's only change
Sun sets on the old
But we're nocturnal anyway
And this is how we know
It'll be okay
These are the times we will hold
These are the times we will hold
These are the times, woo!
These are the times we will hold in the silence
When I've given all of me
And it's alright that it's over
And I've found fight like a soldier
Coming home, in the silence
But I have never felt so free
The future's so bright, this is our time
And I'll live it how I dream, woah
Because it's all we know
And it's only change
Sun sets on the old
But we're nocturnal anyway
And this is how we know
It'll be okay
These are the times we will hold
When our memories fade
Yeah, they fade, oh
Sometimes it takes times like these to know
You're in the right place
Yeah, woo!

Nice to meet you, where you been
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven sin
Saw you there, and I thought
'Oh my god, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play'
Oh no
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumours fly
And I know you heard about me
So, hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad girls good for a weekend
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
You gotta love the players
And you love the game
Cos we're young, and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the queen, baby, I'm your king
Find out what you want
Be that guy for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come
Oh no
You're screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turns
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
'Oh my god, who is he?'
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
Cos darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream
So it's gonna be forever (Girls only want love if it's torture)
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over (Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya)
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers (Girls only want love if it's torture)
They'll tell you I'm insane
Cos you know I love the players (Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya)
And you love the game
Cos we're young, and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
I've got a blank space, baby
I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name



And honestly, I've been thinking
A bit too much, maybe not enough
And honestly, yeah I've been drinking
Maybe not enough, I still feel too much
I feel this crush, crush, crush, crush, crush, crush, crush, crush, crush, crush, crush, crush, crush, crush, crush
Uh
I believe I'm falling for your crush
But it's not enough
Yeah
I believe some day I'll change this life
But not tonight
Oh
Uh
I believe I'm falling for your crush
But it's not enough
Yeah
I believe some day I'll change this life
But not tonight
Oh

I think I lost my mind a while ago
'Cause I've been seeing some ghosts
And I'd be lying if I told you I'm fine
But I lie
Yeah, these thoughts I would never speak out loud
I've seen you cry, but I've never seen you
Shout like a hurricane
These shots don't ricochet
Sight blurred, I'm walking dazed, girl
I'm fucking faded
Or maybe wasted, I can't remember how it happened
Oh, I don't know my limits at all
I'm sinking down into my thoughts
Oh my God
But so what if I drank too much?
This ain't love, it's just a firefight
And even if it's not enough
I'll say it once, I swear I never lied
But this is the last time
This is the last time
This is the last time
This is the last time
You'll ever bring me down
But girl, you know I'm drowning
And I keep going down
But I'll swear that I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not
It's friendly fire and sunlight
The aftermath of one too many words I said
When I should've said nothing at all
At all, uh
I gotta stop overthinking and missing what could've been
You were never even really here
But still we are spinning, just liars and cheaters
Right back where we started, but it don't get easier
I am drowning in liquor, and apathy will be the death of me
But so what if I drank too much?
This ain't love, its just a firefight
And even if its not enough
I'll say it once I swear I never lied
But this is the last time
This is the last time
This is the last time
This is the last time
You'll ever bring me down
Last time
This is the last time

And after the storm
I run and run as the rains come
But I look up, I look up
On my knees and out of luck, I look up
Night has always pushed up day
You must know life to see decay
But I won't rot, I won't rot
Not this mind and not this heart
I won't rot
And I took you by the hand
And we stood tall
And remembered our own land
What we stood for
And there will come a time
You'll see, with no more fear
And love will not break your heart
But dismiss your fears
Get over your hill and see
What you find there
With grace in your heart
And flowers in your hair, fuck
So now I cling to what I knew
And saw exactly what was true
But I will hold, I will hold
I will hold with all I have, I will hold
And I will die alone
And be left there
Well, I guess I'll just go home
Oh, God knows where
'Cos death is just so cold
And man, so small
Well I guess I, behind
And what's before
And there'll come a time
You'll see, with no more fears
And love will not break your heart
But dismiss your fears
Get over your hill and see
What you find there
With grace in your heart
And flowers in your hair
And there'll come a time
You'll see, with no more tears
And love will not break your heart
But dismiss your fears
Get over your hill and see
What you find there
With grace in your heart
And flowers in your hair

Keep following my voice
It's all around
The consequence of my choice
And oh, please don't go
I won't forget you
I don't have time for
Got no time to play God
While you were wishing for romance
I was wishing it's over
And I'm wishing I told you
And I'm wishing I'd found her
And now you're hoping for closure
And I am, I am, I am, I am a coward
We will all fall
And they will all talk
And it's all my fault
And I am, I am, I am, I am a coward
And we will all fall
And they will all talk
And it's all my fault
And I am, I am, I am, I am a coward
And we will all fall
And they will all talk
And it's all my fault
And I am, I am, I am, I am a liar
Hold your breath, so I can't take it
Hold your heart, where I can't break it
Guess it's cold, but I'll bend so it's easier
You know, you just let go
And I will never let you know
That I had to lose myself to let you go
Just leave it all behind
If we all pretend I'm sorry
We could all move on just fine
Falling slowly, the skies are above me
And scattered hope has found their way to me
But you know what I forgot
And I know just who I'm not
And I won't, I won't, I won't be who you want me to be
And we will both fall
And they will all talk
And it's all my fault
And I am, I am, I am, I am a coward
The love we lost
No one could have saved us
And that is all my fault
But I am, I am, I am, I am a hero
And we will both fall
And they will all talk
And it's all my fault
But I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I am not sorry

I can see a storm coming
And in your eyes
I can see myself
But oh, don't fail me now
This love I've found
Don't fall away, yeah
Cuttin' in-
In your eyes
And in your eyes
I can see a storm coming
In your eyes
I can see myself
But oh, don't fail me now
This love I've found
Don't fall away
In your eyes





To be so left behind at the start
When I always thought Id be so much further
So far away from here
Souls, on fire
But it feels so heavy
But it feels so heavy
So I'm HK bound
But it means nothing to me cause I feel at home
When theres no one left to scream at all I've done
But I've learned to let fear go
Cause all I've done
Cause all I've done
Cause all I've done is give the world my

Does it feel good, that I'm gone again?
Is it enough, that I'm wrong again?
And you, won't know
And you, don't know
That you, took it all and it falls again but I don't care anymore
And all we got is slowly falling, ooh
I'd just do it all again and ooh
I can feel the future calling and life won't get the best of me again
All we got is slowly falling and life won't get the best of me again

The lights we shone burn us out
So I just keep running
But I can't catch this horizon
And it's always just further than I
No, it never ends
I fear what I'm dreaming of
I know it feels like heaven when you are lost
And it feels like I'm out of time
And it feels like an end I can't override
No not this time
In the beginning
We always dreamed to be where we are now
The human condition
We chase lines that we redefine
So close but still so far
I'm falling apart
Want to be what the world forgot
And I know it feels like heaven when you are lost
But it feels like I'm out of time
And it feels like an end I can't override
And it feels like I'm watching my childhood dreams just fade and die
Oh, we grow older
But never learn to say
Goodbye

1, 2, 3
Yeah, she’s in love with the concept
As if we’re all just how she imagined
'Cause "we’re in love but just don’t know it yet", huh
Well, tell me how am I supposed to see the magic?
'Cause I don’t believe in it no more
But I won’t tell her
'Cause I always imagined
It’s easier if she thinks she won
So Imma let her, and she said
"I don’t think I love you no more
You never seem to call me lately."
Girl I don’t think you know me at all
'Cause I never thought I'd have to say this
No I don’t love you, and I never did
Look at us burning down in flames for kicks but just know
I’m not singing for your XO
I’m just singing 'cause it's over
Came and went like the summer time
Was that a sunset or a sunrise?
Looking back like where’d the time go
So much for trying to keep this moving slow
'Cause I don’t believe in her no more
But I remember
How we talked shit like we knew what we wanted
And I still remember what she said
"I don’t think I love you no more
You never seem to call me lately."
But I don’t think she knew me at all
'Cause I never thought I'd have to say this
But I’m no liar, and I never hid
Anything, you should have seen it coming to this just know
I’m not singing for an ex though
I’m just singing 'cause it's over
Girl I’m just singing
Just singing yeah
I’m just singing 'cause it's over

"Our deepest fear's not that we are inadequete, our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. Your playin' small does not serve the world, there is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We were all meant to shine as children do."
"Let me tell you something you already know. The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows. It's a very mean, and nasty place, and I don't care how tough you are, it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain’t about how hard ya hit. It’s about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward."
"It’s about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward. That’s how winning is done! Now if you know what you’re worth then go out and get what you’re worth. But ya gotta be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers saying you ain’t where you wanna be because of him, or her, or anybody! Cowards do that and that ain’t you! You’re better than that!"
"I don’t know what to say, really. Three minutes till the biggest battle of our professional lives all comes down to today. Now either we heal as a team or we’re gonna crumble, inch by inch, play by play, 'til we’re finished. We’re in hell right now, gentlemen, believe me. And, we can stay here -- get the shit kicked out of us -- or we can fight our way back into the light. We can climb outta hell"

If I told you how this story ends
Would you change a step you take?
And if I could relive all of my days
I'd live them all the same
'Cause I'm scared, of all that I don't know
'Cause I want it all but all of it ain't gold
And I'm scared, but I know it's not for long
'Cause I'm learning what I should've long before
That all we are
Is a light into the darkness;
And all we are
Is time that's counting down
And all we are
Is falling through the spaces in between;
Endless flight
A lifetime in repeat
But I still find solace
When you say that you know how I feel
When it's wrong
And it ain't been right for years
Let go, give these ghosts a new home;
Let's bury our past and our fears and all these bones
Let's go, I should've seen it long before;
'Cause this is my life
I will not run in circles
Ending where I start
So hold on to me
We'll burn out slowly
And feel our hearts leap
To words we don't mean:
Love
Means nothing to me
'cause I don't know what it is
I'm just dying to be
All that I've been dreaming of
And words betray me
Contradict all I stand for;
But I'm still learning
Yeah I'm still learning
That all we are
Is a light into the darkness
And oh we are
Just time that's counting down
And all we are
Is falling through the spaces in between;
Endless flight
We're falling to our knees

Oh I could be
All it is you need
'Cause we are trying to find a way to feel
If I could sleep
I'd dream of what we'd be
But I can feel you slip further from me
Oh it makes it hard to be
When you are all that I want
But don't have
And I'll run into the sea
Follow this heart that escapes me
It escapes me
And I'm lost
Forget me, all I was
And become everything
All I wanted
And I'm lost
Forget me, all I was
And become everything
All I wanted
Although it feels like heaven
I can't wait forever
Old habits are hard to break
I'm losing faith
Maybe we're better off this way
But I'm still lost
Forget me, all I was
And become everything
All I wanted
And I'm lost
Forget me, all I was
And become everything
All I wanted

Life, Life, Life
This is life, it's all we know
So hold me close, don't let me go
So this is life, it's our fool's gold
So hold me close, don't let me go
"It's really what you want in life, you wanna feel connected, you wanna feel relevant"
Life, life, woah, woah (Woah, woah)
