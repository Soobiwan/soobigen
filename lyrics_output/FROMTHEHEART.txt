I used to turn my head right around (right around)
At the littlest things
Now I shed my skin, no bowin' just cryin' out
"I don't feel it!"
If it seems like I'm makin' this up
"Where'd you get yo confidence?"
"Where'd you get yo strength from?"
Don't tell me you don't know
I don't feel it anymore
I'm waking up
I won't back down
Ready or not, yeah
I don't feel it anymore
I've said it once
Rehearsed it twice
Ready or not, yeah
I don't feel it anymore
Oh woahhh, ohhh
Oh woahhh, ohhh

Remember when everything was simple?
When all we wanted was more?
All the times that we shared
Remember cryin' on the floor?

You see me
Better watch it 'fore you fall, oh
They see me making it far up
Caught you looking at me far out

Better watch it ’fore you fall, oh
You can say that the world is gonna end
The last thing I wanted was to lose another friend
bad, but we break and then we bend
Break and then we bend, bop, bop it 'til the end
I wish that I was stupid, I wasn't complacent
my assumption
Maybe when the beat drops, I won’t try to  it
Maybe when , I won't try to
Tell me, are the speakers on?
my mind is stuck on everything  mean to me
I guess  mean to you
I hope I'm not
We seen that shit you pull, don't get it twisted, you should stop it
When it's coming from the heart, that's how you know that banger bopping
Middle finger flashing, head spinning
Too extreme to top it
Too extreme, the trending topic
Too extreme the way we drop it
We seen that shit you pull, don't get it twisted, you should stop it
When it's coming from the heart, that’s how you know that banger bopping
Middle finger flashing, head spinning
Too extreme to top it
Too extreme, the trending topic
Too extreme the way we drop it
They see me making it far up
Caught you looking at me far out
You see me
Better watch it ’fore you fall, oh
You can say that the world is gonna end
The last thing I wanted was to lose was another friend
bad, but we break and then we bend
Break and then we bend, bop, bop it 'til the end

And I think about you highly (yeah)
I'd be so sad to see you cry about this
We're speeding down the highway now
Can't remember the last time I saw you smile
(Ooh, oooh ooh)
It could be for the best yeah
To throw this in the fire
(Ooh, oooh ooh)
I don't want a confession
I'm just bored of burning tires
Doin' donuts 'round the subject
Things were better at one point in time (point in time)
Movin' faster n' faster
But I'd do anything to see you smile
(Ooh, oooh ooh)
It could be for the best yeah
To throw this in the fire
(Ooh, oooh ooh)
I don't want a confession

You (you)
Keep hoggin' up my time
And barely let me whine
And I (I)
Think it's bout damn time for me to shine
Is this what you wanted?

Don't disturb the water, let me be still
Could you tell me what it's all for?
Tell me what it's all for
Put your money where your heart is, swim in my lows
Pick the car up where you parked it before it gets towed
Could you tell me what it's all for?
Tell me what it's all for
And I need you to stop it
Think it's time to call it
And you don't need to call me anymore
Quit overlooking details
This isn't really fair
You can try to find me
But I'm thinkin' I'll be far away (far away)
I just need to catch some air (I just need to catch some air)
I just need to catch some air (I just need to catch some air)

Don't disturb the water, let me be still
Could you tell me what it's all for?

Put your money where your heart is, swim in my lows
Pick the car up where you parked it before it gets towed
Could you tell me what it's all for?

Maybe you're better than that
Maybe you're better than that
Dig your own hole then ask me to fall down (F-F-FROMTHEHEART)

'Bout all the ways you dragged me 'round
The taste is out my mouth
Like, what would I be livin' for
If I was never given into ya'?
Baby, I'll get it on track
See, it takes two to make a thing go right
More like three or four or five
I'll bе immortal in another life
Yeah, I don't fuck with Uzi Vеrt but fuck what
Cut her up  but I'll never fuck with what you are
Your pros are so exhausting so I
Hear my phone ring, drop the phone
I can see a sinner
I'm a deity but I don't fuck with sinners
Your true colors don't even match my outfit (Ayy)
I carried your baggage, I look better without it (Woah)
I prefer a Louie or a Fendi to out it (Ayy)
I been feelin boujee, now I'm finally grounded
You dragged me around (Bitch)
Bitch, steal the money, why the fuck did I allow this? ('low this)

Wasted years of my life overthinking 'bout how everybody gonna look at me

Cut mad people off like butchery
My fit's illegal, that’s crookery
But hopefully I look so fresh that I score a boy who gon' cook for me
Nah, I just said that cause it rhymed, we can Uber Eats some shit
You wanna step inside my mind, 20,000 tweets of it
I’m oversharing all the time
Must be some sort of new problem caused by growin' up online now (Yeah, I might fuck up)
So if I get on stage and forget all my words
Could you, like, sing 'em back, but don’t rewrite my verse
I’m tryna stay true
Stay true
Stay true
Stay true
Stay true
Stay true
Do you like how I switch like that?
I know you do but I still ask, I don’t wanna be a bitch like that
And you been useful like guitar when I’m tryna itch my back
It just gets lonely when you're far away and not in my lap
Started staying up for your time zone
I get so flustered about you that I open RhymeZone
Every time I see you now, it fucks up every ribosome
You know how far I would speed if you needed a ride home
Vroom, car going fast
Do a wheelie on the tar so it lasts
Oh, how you make me bleed like that?
Okay fuck it, I'mma have and eat my cake
Be myself, make the money, fuck the cops, gender's fake
Roll a blunt on the tummy, goin' on bender 8
Get kicked out of the convention, bring the party to your place
Blue checks blowin' up my mentions but they're really just my friends
And I don't have bad intentions, I'm just tying up loose ends
Into bowline knots, I know that shit like shoutout 2010
So if I get on stage and forget all my words
Could you, like, sing 'em back, but don’t rewrite my verse
I’m tryna stay true
Stay true
Stay true
Stay true
Stay true
Stay true
Do you like how I switch like that?
I know you do but I still ask, I don’t wanna be a bitch like that

Heads don't lie when there's gas in the air
My friends stopped popped off fast in the air
Throw your crushed up hands in the air
Fingers crossed in the urgent care
You can keep knockin' but I won't be there
You can keep runnin' but the dogs don't care
But I'll be there
Knockin but you know they don't care
You keep running but the dogs don't care and

I’m stuck here staring at my phone
Stressed paint eyes shadowed forlorn
Stressed from what I’m thinking on
But I can’t seem to just move on
I'm killing time, clock mallet crushed
Got nothing done, I'm messing up
But if I need water, I'll get up
Why is being lazy so much fun when growing up?
The sun might set, but I don't really care for it
Sun might set, but I don't really care for it
I feel stressed but I doubt I'll fully bear for it
I don't really care for it, I don't really care for it
The sun might set, but I don't really care for it
Sun might set, but I don't really care for it
I feel stressed but I doubt I'll fully bear for it
I don't really care for it, I don't really care for it
'Cause I wear XL and she wears old clothes
She's got an iPhone, and I've got a Pear Phone
She wears short skirts, I wear T-Shirts
She's from Manhattan, and I've got a feature
I- I- I- I don't even wanna get it out there you heard
If I'm gon finish last
Then you had better finish third
He's not spreading rumors, don't care what you overheard
Better get acquainted, I'mma quote it word for word
The sun might set, but I don't really care for it
Sun might set, but I don't really care for it
I feel stressed but I doubt I'll fully bear for it
I don't really care for it, I don't really care for it
The sun might set, but I don't really care for it
Sun might set, but I don't really care for it
I feel stressed but I doubt I'll fully bear for it
I don't really care for it, I don't really care for it
Because the sun might set, but I don't really care for it
Sun might set, but I don't really care for it
I feel stressed but I doubt I'll fully bear for it
I don't really care for it, I don't really care
The sun might set, but I don't really care for it
Sun might set, but I don't really care for it
I feel stressed but I doubt I'll fully bear for it
I don't really care for it, I don't really care

Blow through all my money
Just to make things worsе on purpose
I'm a brand new teenage heartthrob
But I don't wanna put the work in
I swear that I'll give back what I borrowed
I can do it on my own, I don't need your help
And you could hit me back tomorrow
All I do is take, I can't stop myself
So you don't like where I'm headed (No, I don't)
I know that something's gotta change, but I don't know what
So I took some psychedelics (Oh my god)
I'm looking for something to last me the brand new sound
I've been working on it all day, and I like how the rhythm

Too much on my plate
I needed a vacation

Feel like I woke up on Indiana time

OUT NOWDo you feel strength in me?
Do you feel strength in me?
Everlasting joy coming from your touch
But it's been so long
It's been so fucking long
Since I've straddled through the dust
You can't tell me who I am
You can't tell me who I was
All I know is I'm here now
And other than that I don't know much

F-F-FROMTHEHEART
Can't keep track of the time
They say that it'll be fine
I'm damn near losin' my mind
Can't keep runnin' away
Losin' it
Lately, I've been losin' it
They say, "You'll get used to it"
They say, "You'll get used to it"
Lately, I've been losin' it
Lately, I've been losin' it
They say, "You'll get used to it"
They say, "You'll get used to it"
Wait, I don't know where I'm at
I done lost my way, even lookin' at the map
I was tryna live my life, then I fell into a trap
But that's how shit is, I can't argue with that
I was walkin' the way that they wanted me to
And they still didn't like me, so fuck all them too
Do what I want with whoever I want and whenever I want
But lately, I've been losin' it
With life, I've just been cruisin' it
I got people who do what I say to do
So, obviously, I don't need you
How many times should I tell you, "I hate you"
'Til you get it? I don't get you
Fuck me? Then, fuck you
You don't know me? I don't know you (Oh, oh, oh)
That's why I ghosted you
What the fuck was I supposed to do? (Supposed to do?)
Where're my social cues?
Funny thing, I've been avoidin' you
'Cause I don't know me either
Thought takin' that tab would delete it
Now I'm on a one-way track to my demons
And ever since that
I've been losin' composure
Feeling shoulder-to-shoulder
Summer's never been colder
Don't wanna die when I'm older
And get a routine, so I'm letting go
I've never been a bad guy
December I'll be home, 'cause I'm—
Losin' it
Lately, I've been losin' it
They say, "You'll get used to it"
They say, "You'll get used to it"
Lately, I've been losin' it
Lately, I've been losin' it
They say, "You'll get used to it"
They say, "You'll get used to it"
Take my hand and run away
I wouldn't have this any other way
Don't need your love, I suffocate
So I'll get drunk, man, what a waste
Expensive clothes, designer drugs
You think it's not enough
No else's does, you tweetin' sucks
You need to tighten up
And he has a wife, but he loves his mistress
If you blink twice, you might fuckin' miss it
I cross my enemies off my hit list
I'm worthless, just a pot to piss in
I slam my head against the wall
And I know you don't care at all
And I can't seem to brush it off
Need ego-death and Adderall
Ooh, never thought it'd hurt to try
You hurt me when you looked in my eyes
Like, "Hurry, we ain't got no time"
And you, keep shootin' all my birds from the air
Cl—clueless to the fact that I don't care
'Cause when the world's ending
I can't be fendin' for myself
Losin' it
Lately, I've been losin' it
They say, "You'll get used to it"
They say, "You'll get used to it"

Can't keep track of the time, you damn near made me cry
I waited every night, I held it in every five
And when you call my name
I turn around and I hear you say, "Trust me, just trust me"
I just hope I don't fall in love this time
One, two, three, gonna make me cough this time
I said my feelings but that's a fucking lie and
Truth be told, I'm not the toughest guy, fuck disguises
'Cause I'm above the likes
No blue birdiе is gonna take my tongue
I had to wait, I had way too much to fight now
I can't see clearly bеcause I bate my mind, hate my body
I'm gonna flex, like, mhm
I'm gonna be livin' my best life, mhm
Ask me out, I'm gonna say yes, like, mhm
You talking spades, I'm saying less 'cause
I shoot the moon for you
And if you take my heart and break it
I don't think I could take it
So if you love me then say it, say it
I just hope I don't fall in love this time
Would you love me the way I loved you for so long, so long?
If thoughts pass my mind every time I think, I can't control what I think anymore, anymore
It's up to you, not up to me how this plays out this time
I've given everything I can to you, I don't think I can do anything else to try
Try to—, try to find space
I don't need lies, I don't need to save face
I don't backtrack, I just need space
I just trust me, I just need to explain (Explain)
'Til I try to find space
I don't need lies, I don't need to save face
I don't backtrack, I just need space
I just trust me, I just need to explain
I said I'm losin' my mind (Lost my mind)
I said it's gonna be fine (You'll be fine)
I said I'm takin' my time (To realign)
You said, "Trust me, just trust me"

Take the scenic route, we could see the view
Feel like ice 'cause I got the cold brew
If we're talkin' 'bout looks, baby, you know it's all you
Let's get away from here
Everything is better when your face is near, oh
Running 'til the place is clear
Baby, when you're with me, there's no place to fear, oh

Do what I want and I know they hate it
Try to speak when I let the blade hit
Forget about this, I'ma get sedated
Backwood, cigarette, perfume
You know that everywhere I go, gotta blow up the tunes
I hit a big mood swing, then I hit the booth
I was lying on the phone, now I'm out on the roof
